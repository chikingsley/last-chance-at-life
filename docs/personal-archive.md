# The Architecture Stack - How It All Connects

Think of it as layers:

Dublin Core Metadata (Bottom layer) - This is just your filing system. It's 15 basic fields (title, creator, date, etc.) that ensure every piece of content has consistent labels. For you: title, date, location, content, medium. You've already got this right.
AMEDIA-Model (Conceptual framework) - This isn't a tool, it's a theory about how digital records interact with memory. It says: when you analyze old content, you're not just processing data - you're reconstructing memories through an iterative dialogue between what you wrote/recorded and what you remember now. This guides HOW you analyze, not what tools you use.
Neo4j/Knowledge Graphs (Analysis layer) - This is where your actual data lives and gets connected. Neo4j turns your linear blog posts into a web where "Mary" mentioned in 2019 connects to "relationship anxiety" in 2021 connects to "trust issues" in your voice notes.

The Gap Problem - What I Glossed Over
You caught me being vague. Here's what gap-filling actually means:
Identifying gaps:

Run a simple Python script to find date ranges with no entries
Look for pronouns without antecedents ("she said..." - who's she?)
Find events referenced but never explained ("after what happened in Seattle")

Filling gaps:

You CAN'T magically reconstruct missing data
You CAN add context notes: "She = probably Sarah based on timeline"
You CAN use "anchor events" (moves, breakups, job changes) to bracket uncertain periods
You CAN mark confidence levels: "High confidence this is about Mary" vs "Could be Mary or Lisa"

What Analysis Actually Looks Like With LLMs
Here's the practical workflow:

## Stage 1: Basic Extraction (What LLMs are perfect for)

python

For each document:

- Extract all person names/aliases
- Identify emotional valence (-5 to +5)
- Pull out key themes
- Identify temporal markers
- Extract relationship dynamics

## Stage 2: Pattern Recognition (LLMs + Python)

Word frequency over time (Python)
Emotional trajectory graphs (Python visualization)
Theme co-occurrence (who appears with what emotions?)
Linguistic style changes (formal vs casual over years)

## Stage 3: Framework Application (This is where you choose your lens)

Attachment: Look for proximity-seeking vs avoidance language
Jungian: Track shadow material (what you reject/project)
ADHD/RSD: Rejection sensitivity patterns, emotional dysregulation spikes
Big Five: Map language to personality dimensions

The Real Starting Point
Fuck the perfect system. Here's what to actually do:

This week: Get all content into one CSV with your 5 columns
Next: Run ONE blog post through Claude with this prompt:
Extract: people mentioned, emotions expressed, key events,
questions this raises, confidence level for each extraction

Then: Build a simple Neo4j graph with just people and dates
Finally: Add layers as needed

Hypothesis vs Exploration
Do both:

Exploration: "What themes appear most often?"
Hypothesis: "Do I show RSD patterns after romantic rejections?"

The best insights come from bouncing between the two.
What You're Missing in Frameworks
You mentioned the main ones, but consider:

Narrative Coherence Theory: How integrated vs fragmented are your stories over time?
Interpersonal Process Theory: How do your relational patterns repeat?
Schema Therapy: What early maladaptive schemas show up repeatedly?
