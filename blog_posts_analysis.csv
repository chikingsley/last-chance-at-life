dead. again,2023-10-24 05:38:00,i just don't know how long i can keep doing thisthere's just simply no reason to. there's just no reason. there's just nothing. i'm working for what.nothingfor the love of the game and i don't love the game anymore. i don't love anything.well that's not true. i love the rare feeling of connection with a woman. i love candy and a feel good movie. i like making things that are good specifically video. i like recieving things that i designed in the mail and unboxing them first time. i like food sometimes.but man are these reasons to stay alive.are they enough. there not enough to keep me awake i can say. i'm in purgatory. and i tate it so much here i might as well be in hell or actually dead and sent back to the infinite nothing.oh to be released.oh to be released.
Berlin,2016-12-29 12:10:00,"Berlin is an asshole. A big dirty asshole that has specks of possible greatness in it if it were experienced correctly i.e. just like any asshole. Ass is wonderful but if is a dirty ass then it is disgusting. That goes without saying but I feel that I must make the distinction for the future understanding of this article. One thing: the metro and all busses are essentially free. I don't know how this public transit system works because literally no one has a ticket. They never check when you get on busses and there are no turnstyles at the metro station. Either taxes are high as fuck or there is some secret that is only privy to residents. There is also no sales tax... so now I understand less how the public works are paid for. I visited some of the big things (excepts that wall which I did want to see but not enough to get on the metro and go all the way there). I saw the Bradenton Tor. But really all of the sights were extremely underwhelming. It felt like I had already seen all of this before in Paris except it was better with a more attractive language (that I could moderately understand). I will go into comparing cities here which isn't fully fair because they are different places meant to be enjoyed on their own terms. But fuck it. Paris was more quaint. It was more rich. Berlin is shit. I understand the reason why Parisiennes don't speak anything but their language now and are very pissed about immigration: because they see what has happened to Berlin and want to prevent that at all costs. When walking around Berlin, you will see people from all races and backgrounds. Very different from Paris, where it was mostly white people (which I liked better). There were also a shit ton of people there that were just casually speaking Arabic. I actually went to Berlin to visit my two friends from Egypt whom I met in the Paris Hostel that I stayed in. I did not like staying with them. It really got on my nerves when they would speak in Arabic. The general language did not bother me, it was the fact that I was not included. I am also your friend but I am excluded from 70-90% of the discussions that are happening around me. It is very frustrating and creates this need for me to leave or do something. In the end, I decided to do both... Leave and go to a club. From now on, I will not do this. I should really express that if you are going to be my friend, I prefer it, if possible, for you to speak my language. That sounds bad but I really mean it is a way that means that you include everyone in your discussions. I don't give a fuck if you are talking on the phone or to a passerby. But if we are alone with another friend, include all of us. Thanks. Note to self pt. 2: never put yourself at the behest of someone who"
i'm giving up - chemical engineering was a waste and is now over,2019-09-10 21:59:00,"I don't know what is happening. Nope fuck that, I do. I don't know what the actual ever living fuck is happening behind the scenes but I cannot get another corporate job with the degree that I have. The powers that be will not let me back in. I have been blacklisted and I don't know how to continue. I'm upset. I'm pissed. I have $20k in debt, I studied my ass off for 6 years, I labored in pain and anguish, sacrificing that which was most important to me (time) for nothing. For fucking nothing. I'm here, 50 dollars in credit left, sitting in a public library wondering what to do next. If this isn't a sign from God the universe, I don't know what else is. I am not meant to do this bullshit. They will not let me. I've applied and applied and they will not let me back in the doors of the places that I left. I have to leave the industry altogether and explore where the world will take me. It hurts to have to say all of this. It hurts that this is the real reason why I am having to take this leap. I was interested in trying out teaching english abroad and now my finances, options and life are forcing me to. I've enjoyed a lot of my time working in the USA. Even at the jobs that I hated. Even at the jobs that I got fired from. I learned from every experience and now I have to apply the grind of life to a new wheel: language learning, teaching language, entrepreneurship, and coding. I no longer have the luxury of golden handcuffs in America... I unknowingly gave that up when I got fired from Evoqua. I've been living a lie to a lot of the people that have met me in the past four months and now it's time to set the record straight. I've been living out of my car for the past two years and I've been unemployed for the past four months. I have 20k in student loan debt and 15k in credit card debt. I pride myself in the world that I've created for myself and the friends that I've been able to make despite my situation. I love everyone that I've met in this country and I will miss you all. Keep up with me via all of the social medias and feel free to visit me in whatever country I end up in. Turns out I will get the opportunity to try out my 6 month becoming famous theory after all."
my personal morality is gone - long live hoe chi minh,2018-12-04 16:04:00,"12/04/18 7:30 pm --> Hoe Chi Minh is alive. He is well. He was consummated and concieved on the night of 12/04/18 when Disney Channel Chi decided to engage in sexual relations with a married woman with the husband and kids in the same house. 12/04/18 12:00 am --> Disney Channel Chi was still alive at that point. He has life threatening injuries but he might have made it if Hoe Chi was repentant. 12/05/18 10:11 am --> He's dead. Dark Triad nigga is here. Done giving a fuck. Learn how to be a Dom. Learn how to talk dirty. Fuck and dominate these hoes. Disney Channel ass nigga, it's over for you. Hoe Chi Minh has arrived to create Hoegwarts, School of Hoecraft and Hoetry. Eulogy for the man I was and used to be Disney Channel Chi was a wonderful young kid, naive but wonderful all the same. He loved to read books about dragons and mythology, rats, mice and rabbits fighting for the good of the land, mythical king god lions who rule the worlds beyond the wardrobe. He loved to make jokes and, though he was shy to do certain things, he was outgoing and everyone liked him in one way or another. He cared mostly about sports and Call of Duty, both of which he put countless hours into. Girls were always something that frustrated him but the calling of the other activities that he loved kept the anxiety around that at bay. He was a virgin for most of his short life until college when he first met Hoe Chi (Hoe Chi Minh's father). Hoe Chi took over a lot of life leaving DCC to worry about the wife and the kids and principles. He died doing what he loved: platonically meeting women with no goal in mind. Little did he know that Hoe Chi had already manipulated the energy in the atmosphere and created the vortexual place that no woman can escape much less a mother who has been deprived for god knows how long. That night, he suffered life threatening wounds to the morality that was the center of his existence. He died the morning of the next day when Hoe Chi Minh scheduled a follow-up day to fuck the wife of the man he had just spurned and a mother to the kids who's parent's marriage that was on the line. I will remember him every time I cuddle, every time I look into a girls eyes, and every time I use the word love. I will remember him with every new body, relationship and country. He is gone but god fucking damn him, he will never be forgotten. The man I am Nothing is true, everything is permitted."
The cunt set the tone,2019-09-01 04:24:00,"I walk into work today. I go in nice and jovial My first remark was to the general manager, Ariel, who was wearing a mighty fine black dress. I say, “Wow, this is a fancy dress, what are you dressing up for?” And she remarked, snidely and curtly, “Well I’m the manager... ... ... ... I also wear dresses on Saturdays.” But it was really the way that she said that she was the manager... like I didn’t already know that. I didn’t like that and that remark put me in a survival quiet mode the whole night. I went full retard. Clear head, only actions, only doing what I needed to for the next moment to go off without a hitch. There were many times that I stuttered because the actions I was taking were moving faster than my brain could conjure up the words. This may be a form of the flow state. But goddamn, I didn’t experience any of the mild to significant euphoria that I’ve experienced in flows for other activities. I didn’t enjoy today. Part of ti was definitely the fact that if I really forced myself to partake In the jovial back and forth banter, I would probably become part of the team faster, become respected by the manager, and get a quicker path to bartendership. That said, similar to how I felt back in may, I don’t really want to enact the labor needed to get me higher... And this is interesting to me. I can and do give out as much energy as I have to give out. I am very much ruled by the emotions of the moment though in the past few years, I have expanded the higher end of those emotional bursts. I thought I was pushing through the negative feeling of the lack of will to act when really I’ve been trying to cultivate that will to act from the beginning of any day which I plan on taking action and then sliding down the proverbial slide that I built. It works out often, but in certain cases, it can really come across as bland, unfeeling, or impersonal. Maybe I should work on that. I will be trying to go out later tonight. I actually don’t know how I’m going to do this considering how feebly tired I am and seeing as I have no friends to partake in this journey with me. I am back to chasing pussy for the sake of it. Wish me luck."
my opinion of my self is getting lower,2019-06-18 14:05:00,"I can't fuck an attractive girl to save my life, I can find no way to proceed in my business, I can't be on time for anything even when I'm at the fucking airport... like nigga I've missed 3 flights in a row. How is that even a thing. And I can't find any way to proceed in the other parts of my life i.e. finish the fucking piece of paper that I need to teach English abroad with. That is the only thing that I need to survive and I can't get it. This is stupid and frustrating and goddamn it. What's happened to me? I don't know who I am right now. I can't recognize any part of me. The unearthly confidence is almost a gimmick at this point. I can have fun despite those around me but can I leverage it into something... almost. I'm speaking about my adventure in St. Beach that left me wandering the streets for 3-5 hours searching for the place where I had left all of my things. Fuck it. Quick story time for posterity because god knows, I will never remember this part of the trip again if it doesn't get transferred to. So. I end up at a karaoke place with Jacob Fast, the groom and a lot of the people that came to the wedding. I had a lot of fun there... I was wearing my short shorts and dancing like a madman. I danced with 3-4 old ladies, I danced with the hottest girl at the wedding who was dating a law enforcement officer who was present (we absolutely killed that shit and I could see on his face he was not excited about this happening though he refused under any circumstance to dance so I had to take her night into my own hands), I danced with a drunk married woman who made so many advances on me that her husband had to physically pull her away and leave. I sang Breaking Free with a cool dude from the wedding and spotted a girl from across the bar who was wearing bikini bottoms and a long shirt... I danced with her and got in a cab with her and her chill hot friend @ashlynbrookelyn some guy, and an old lady that I had met earlier. We went to the next bar where we proceeded to be the center of attention and entertainment for the rest of the night. The bikini girl called me a bitch at some point whereupon I corrected her and said my name was hoe bitch which was my nickname for the rest of the night. I ended up somehow breathing life into her chill hot friend and getting several pecks on the lips for the last 20m of the night. That's when I found out that there is a song called Hoe Town Road which is a raunchy out-of-control version of the famous Old Town Road. There was so much fun content that happened but unfortunately, my phone was dead and there was no one to film the amazingness that happened between bikini girl and me and the chill hot friend and me. I tried to go home with the chill drunk friend after she split from her friend... she said no and wasn't going for the shared uber tactic. She ended up hard dismissing me and I didn't want to fight through potential hard creepiness for something that I didn't really care about doing. So I let her be comfortable in her silence while I wandered off into the dark, proceeding to get utterly and hopelessly lost for hours and hours, going from resort to store to resort asking for directions. I laid down about 1-2 hours in and planned on just sleeping right there on the sidewalk in the middle of a bridge until someone found me and took me home. I wanted to quit so bad... then I just didn't. I went one more stop and asked the guy not only for directions but also to look at the map and see the streets I had to pass to get where I needed to go. It was that moment where I decided to run the rest of the way... I ran at least 2 miles. I was dying My brain was asleep, my joints hurt and I didn't think that I could make it. But here I am. I surprised myself again. And that is the amazing and frustrating thing... most of the things that I want to do, I can accomplish. I just have to put my mind on it and let go. It's just starting the grind that is so difficult. Lastly, I had sex with a 2 on the beach. It was cool and beautiful outside but the girl was not so I didn't care at all. I really do think that fucking this type of girl really devalues sex in general and fucking those skinny beautiful girls is so worth the wait that I should stop bothering with these novelty fucks. That said, it was a strong novelty fuck... public on the beach, dangerous sand everywhere, no condom. It was a girl's dream. I just want to do it with a hot girl next time lol."
no more social media? interesting suggestion (self hate),2022-07-23 22:14:00,"jack suggested i take a break from social media to enjoy creating content for the sake of it and understand the original reason and the joy that I can get from such an activity. it pains me to even consider a break since one of the ideas in my brain is that consistency for a long period leads to success and making a shitty tiktok everyday for a year is better than making zero tiktoks for a year.and that seems true to me regardless. that said - taking a break from the socials is an idea - like the idea would be to create for myself rather than the world and enjoy it as opposed to looking at the metrics. The metrics side of things has died down for me for the most part though.Now the reason to get out would be to be exposed less to the addictive negativity of the internet. I'm such an internet boy now in a similar way to when I was 18 and first into the girl shit. the difference is that this time I am consuming negative political garbage for the sake of it rather than consuming fun talk shows of patrice talking shit about women or watching simple pickup or rsd and getting ideas for where to take my future. now I'm watching arguments on abortion and watching right and left takedowns of each other... and watching a fuck ton of destiny... like mountains and hours lol. destiny is the new patrice for me goddamnI don't like that though because there is no personal development in this content. it's just content for contents sake. now if I'm honest, back in the day I consumed a bunch as well. it was mostly the office but I also caught up on a lot of pop culture that I had missed in my formative years. a lot. i mean I binged game of thrones, lord of the rings, harry potter, lost, and countless other shows that I can't ever remember anymore. i enjoyed it - I definitely didn't beat myself up back then for those actions. interesting.that was because I only had one goal though - get good grades in the classes I was in at the moment. eventually I would add girls to that but those two things were the only goals I had in that young life. now my goals are weasely. the most optimal robotic version of myself wouldknow russiango out and talk to girls and be social batch up tiktoks one day a week and schedule all that shit upedit big yt videos throughout the week and post 1-7 per week (would love to do daily vlogging just to improve content or get into workflow)do bodyweight exercised dailywork everyday and make decent moneysew clothing and be good at itthis would be my beautiful new world. that said, there really are a limited amount of hours in the day. the tasks that truly consume the most time are tiktoking, yt-ing and sewing - the reason being that i get into flow states and want to continue doing the activity until it is donesometimes that's possible and other times the task was so difficult that i wasn't able to get it done so I just continued doing it and fudged up my whole dayblah blahreturning to this at 2:58 pma big reason that I wanted to leave social media was because I get jealous of other people's success. Even in public now...fuck me I just saw this pretty girl who is probably my age in a sundress... and now I am looking at these probably underage bu cute girls and I am angry at myself. I am angry that I wasn't able to talk to these girls when I was young. I am angry that the default position as a person in my body isn't to start a conversation with the cute contemporary sundress girl. I am angry that I don't have the drive or hustle to start a successful business and get ahead like alex homozi or any of these online guru guys. I'm angry that it feels like I've been late to every single platformand that it's too late for me to build a following further than my current superficial. I am angry and jealous and upset and that leads me to a state of wanting to give up. when i give up i hate myself even more for being the tupe of person who would just give up. I ratchet enough self belief and irrationally push through towards another week os doing things. in general through it's enough to stay alive on this planet and not much more. and that is frustrating.and all that while at the same time realizing that if i would have been consistently making content on fucking any platform since I started making content on said platform, I would be much much better and possibly have the following that I am desperate to find gay. stupid. fuck youand why? why do i want this money or online success? so that I can do the things that I want to do with less friction and more freedom. I would love to travel freely around the world - sure that''s possible without money but there's a lot more friction. that said, it seems that i am not willing to suffer for long enough to actually reduce that friction so I should just leave and travel.ahh I'm such a fucker. really in the end I should just shut the fuck up and learn how to code and get one of these remote jobs thateveryone talks about. full stop this is all. really specifically, i should figure out the skills i need to add to be a technical project manager and move towards that. I hate that idea though because it means i have to do things and I don't know if I'll want this in a few weeks. in the end i hate being me and the reason i take adderall regularly is to shut down all thinking parts of my brain except the part the decided which path to go down. unnecessary but then very much necessary considering the state of my broken mind.i want a girl or girls. I want friend. I want to be able to buy food in this panera and enjoy it. I want to be able to travel freely. and theoretically i had a bunch of that shit with my last job. so why the fuck did i even quit. i don't know. because even with potentially having stuff something is missing. of course i hated seattle for the most part. of course i was living out of a car for the majority of the last 10 years. oidk man. i just really don't know where to go next. all of my shortcomings and insecurities have been identified. they've really been identified for years but fuck me if it's been nigh on impossible to make any change. i don't need more experiences but i also don't need to let go and enjoy things. i really really really just want to quit. life. even in this fucking panera, i want t ocurl into a ball and stop existing. just go back into my dark hold of perpetual sleep. nothing happens in sleep. the only issue is that i have to wake up and then hate myself for sleeping instead of sticking with the schedule that I set for myself. what is left for me. not women. not money. maybe traveling. i just don't even know anymore. i am dead. i feel like I've wasted this whole summer. i feel like i haven't lived in weeks or months. i feel like a stale piece of bread. that hasn't started molding but will soon."
the ultimate of imposter syndrome,2019-04-13 13:59:00,"I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. that's where my mind was all night last night after a hot NEW York girl who works on private flights took the drink I bought for her and went back to her friend maybe 30 seconds afterwards. Pain. Anger. Imposter. I have felt this in my work for a long time. I barely made it through engineering and the parts that I cheated to get through. So in the end, I didn't really make it. I really don't belong in this current job in so many ways. But that's fine. That's totally fine because I want something different for myself. I have been grinding and trying to figure out what the next level of my life is going to be. I think designing funny clothes toward the niche of hoeing, travelling, and finding the opportunity where it presents itself anywhere in the world is the next thing for me. but I can't do it while shacked to this specific corporation. That being said, I haven't had sex in over a month... maybe two months. That's not for lack of shooting shots. I've been out here and talked to a shit ton of girls. I just get stuck in the phase right after the introduction. I actually have girls approaching me at this point. Girls approach me and somehow I'm not closing. Imposter. How can I teach other men? How can I steer my entire life toward teaching and living this thing that I apparently am not even good at? It doesn't feel good. I just really have to focus on getting better at what I want to get better at. I have had a streak of judginess and we always talk about the one thing a girl needs from you is that she has to know that you won't judge her. I need to find another way to make my jokes because this hasn't been working. I need to be better. I need to consume only media that is in service of my goals. I need to only look at content that will be beneficial to my next life stage. Politics is entertaining as fuck and I'm addicted but I really have to stop. It serves no actual value in life other than entertainment. I am going to set up a habit tracker for not listening to political podcasts or watching political youtube videos. buy"
weaving reality - the aly confession,2019-10-08 16:00:00,"I'm writing this to create affirmations about my upcoming hangout with Aly. I'm going to do it. I'm going to tell her how I feel about her. The last time we hung out it was awkward and wierd because there was this energy of inaction and this unspoken thing in the room that I tried getting around through touching... didn't work. I need to explicitly tell her how I feel and let the cards fall where they may. My reservations: she's gay and she's told me this. i feel uncomfortable professing my love since this might be desrespecting my knowledge of her sexuality we've been friends for a long time (i guess just 2 years now but still) and I hate for it to seem like I was just being friends with her for ulterior reasons I don't want to lose the relationship that we have. it hasn't been wild or crazy but every time we've hung out, it just feels comfortable and nice My responses to these reservations: If she's offended by your advances, apologize and tell her it's just something that you had to get off of your chest. ""I love you and I'm okay with loving you as a friend. I just really wanted to let you know that I do feel something more here. I am okay with letting that feeling go but I wanted to be vulnerable and express it before I take this big wild step in my life of leaving the country. You are the only girl I feel this so open and comfortable with to express my feelings despite my fear."" If she's offended or feels a way about your approach, apologize and say it's just something you had to say. Now that you expressed it, you can feel comfortable around her and not feel weird hugging or cuddling her since you know that this is just a wonderful platonic love. Same as the ones before. Now all that being said, this is your new reality. This girl is in love with you. She has been in love with you since the day you met, from the day you drover her home, to the day you met her parents at graduation. She's been in love with you for the duration of her relationship with that other girl. She wanted you to make a move in that hotel room in Pittsburgh. She wanted to spend more time with you and was extremely disappointed when you had to dip. She loves your energy and everything about you. You are an amazing wholesome loving guy and she knows who you are. If any girl knows where you're coming from and what you've struggled with, it's this girl. Be open with her tonight and leave everything on the table."
"92 + 93 steph 21 yo, hannah german",2021-07-08 21:14:00,"quick story timemet guy named ricardo who is from peru at wild rover in kirkland on saturday. went ot his place with a guy named christian. ricardo has a nice place with a zebra carpet thing on the floor. i am friends with him now. we met and went out the next day to capital hill. almost went to this place called supernova but it was way too flamboyant and gay so we didn't. we parked and immediately met two girls, steph an asian and courtney a cute white girl. courtney was more attractive but more reserved. we hit it off immediately and went to this bar called unicorn where i bought them and us drinks. we had fun. i was on one. i was talking to everyone and then i led them around the bar making jokes with steph. we left there and went to another place where something similar happened. courtney apparently has a darker past but we didn't go into that much. we left that second bar and it was 1230 and evreything was closing or was dead. i suggested we go back to ricardos place for drinks and the girls agreed - they drove separately and followed us. we got there, ricardo poured wine and we went outside. i started kissing the asian asap. we were touching and kissing for awhile. it took ricardo awhile to get courtney warmed up and into it. but eventually it was fire and he took her to his room. i banged that little asian on the couch. amazing skin. almost completely dry pussy but it got wet when i went in. fucked for 3-7 minutes and came inside after she gave the go ahead. it was nice. not sure how it was for her. we talked for awhile on the couch after we both used the bathroom. they left the place around 5. ricardo apparently didn't fuck courntey because she was too drunk. courntey is a single mom. second girl. met her from hinge. first date, walked aournd with a bottle of white wine while the sun was out. went to 3-4 different spots in kirkland then back ot my place. she thought it was small. we kissed and she sucked my dick a little but then left. she met a couple days later and we danced a tiny bit on my balcony and the wnet inside. i talked to her for awhile before banging. i think she enjoyed it more."
dr phil and sniffing my own farts,2022-10-27 16:05:00,"i'm thinking of all of the profound things that I would or wouldn't say on that show. and again i really don't think i have much to add to the conversation. it is all the same bullshit. a big reason i dislike interacting with people is because it feels like i am reliving the same day over and over and thinking the same thoughts over and overi don't like it. this fucking tiktok shit is over man - like i did it and now i need to be onto something else. fuck making a statement about housing and struggle - blah blah obvious shit about employers paying or not paying people // it's boring and if they bring up the opposition, you can expect the bad faith to be incoming. whatever. anywho the news is that a dr phil producer reached out to me on twitter maybe i'll be on that show for a minute.ha"
going out with people,2018-10-19 16:56:00,"I definitely am more needy when I go out with these RSD guys because there's a level where I have to achieve something at the end of the day. I have to show that I am capable and live up the expectation that has been set for me by myself and the people around me. The issue with that is that when that happens you get put into your head. Most of last night I was in my head and I was doing everything in my power to stay out and about in the atmosphere that was around me. It worked out in the middle to end when I had this girl (doug) that was dancing with me while I danced with other girls... That doesn't make sense but I don't want to rewrite it. Basically, in the middle, I was on fire. Toward the end it started to slow down and there is the issue of sweat. I sweat a shit ton and I really need a sweat band or something to hold off the torrent that comes down after significant efforts. **Buy a lot of sweatbands I also noticed that I wasn't staying in set long enough and I was running out of things to say. Which I literally pride myself on not doing. I definitely ran out of shit to say several times which is a sign that I was in my head and not thinking of the next thing. There is also a set minimum. I think that I should start staying ins given sets for at least 5 minutes. I say that because there was a distinct tendency to leave a set sooner if the girls were extremely attractive. At the end of the night, spanish dude took over my set. I had two girls dancing and going wild before this guy came in and took the girl that I wanted. Fearing for my BS, I let it be while I danced with the other one until she had had enough (I was really going hard and upping the ante) and went to join her friend with the guy. Now in this situation, that dude is holding the whole frame. Just like the other day, the best thing would have been to directly approach the girl and address the dude if she made as if to look at him for assistance. There's a balance though. I know in addition that most of these girls aren't going to say anything if I stay nearby and they will just act weird if they don't want me around. Which is cool, I can read body language but the real question is, when do you fight through that and try to get to the other side. I have done it and it has worked in the past but I am afraid of staying past my due. Cool so just in this conversation I have identified several sticking points: uncomfortable around hot girls, fear of overstaying my welcome, and running out of things to say. The last point should be the easiest to fix since it is literally just be engaging about anything. The first two are weird. Part of it is being able to walk up with sexual intent and say something. I have distinctly gotten away from expressing that intent and instead relied almost solely on premise for the last few months of my game based on the teachings of one Mr. Todd V. I generally like the vibe of that relationship better. Who knows. I'll be out here regardless and the goal is to have fun and collab with as many people as possible before i get off this ride. Good luck."
thoughts for today - never getting married,2017-04-26 03:28:00,"I really do blog more than I do actual things. I ran into the other sex today. I just don't like the way these young girls look at me. I know none of the following things are true but I will relay them anyway because it's how I feel. I feel like I need to drink heavily to talk to any of these girls. There is a wall. There is a wall that I have built up around myself in order to be good at other things. I think I know how to get back in the swing. Knoxville will be the test. I really do think that faced with a new environment and new people, I will succeed. I have no other choice. Here in Morgantown, there is choice. I know it is possible to have balance. The old work life balance is what they call it. I know that it is possible to be extremely good at engineering and have girls interested in you. For god's sake, nigga kobe out here slaying girls left and right. Everytime I even think about talking to one of these girls, strong strong disgust rises in me. It used to be fear and longing and now it is different. I know the excited fear that comes with meeting new men and women. I don't feel it here. Excuses, excuses I know. From here, it looks like a giant clique and when you try to foray in, you get laughed at and shut out. I tried to talk to two girls today. One was a girl who I hadn't seen in a long time. It would have been a pleasant conversation. It was not. I ran out of things to be familiar with her about. My mind is not in date mode, girl mode, bar mode... basically any mode that involves a vagina. I asked how she knew her friends and she introduced me to them. I ended up talking to the one guy for a minute. He was an aerospace engineer. Cool dude. Gave me advice on how to keep my beard legit. Beard balm. The shit has been noted and I will try it. Fuck the other girl in the group. The last one was her boyfriend. What I noticed about most of these dudes is that they never look you in the eye. They all pussy. I don't trust a man or woman who won't look me in the eye. The last girl I talked to before dipping was a blonde (i think). She walked in my direction and was facing me. So I said, ""You look interesting. What is your name?"" and she said her name. Then she turned and talked to the guy in front of me. I don't like cold shoulders. But. Such is life. Such is the great game. I looked around and left. When I got home, where I am now, I looked in the mirror and realized that I probably wasn't smiling when I spoke to that last girl. My face not smiling is unsettling if there is not a conversation happening. So yes, people, she was justified in the boot, not that it would matter whether it was justified or not. I don't like social interaction. Not in this state. The funny thing is, I would do it for my boys. I can put on a face and act interested in these girls long enough for my friend to get solidly engaged. Then I run away and cleanse my body from the hell of pretending to be in a higher state than I am. Incongruency hurts. Physically. I was reading a fantastic book today by... fuck that. by Glennon Doyle Melton. and the research I just did to remember her name and the book brought me to her site. She is got divorced. NIGGA I will read and finish that book. I like te imagery and analogy of her sending her representative, a fake version of herself, into different groups just to fit in. I identify with that and that's exactly what it feels like to behave out of state. As a man, you have to engage with the world in your current mind. Alcohol is cheating. Take on the world or go the fuck home. I will never get married. Fuck that. If this bitch got divorced after LITERALLY WRITING A WHOLE FUCKING BOOK ABOUT FIGHTING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES IN A MARRIAGE, nah I'm good. Y'all can have that. I need to put that shit the fuck out of my mind. Never ever ever will I get married in the USfuckingA."
island burning - the solution to improving those around you,2020-02-06 03:24:00,"too often i look up at the people around me and think damn i wish they were better and too often, I have to move on from engaging in certain activities with specific people because they aren't good enough. This continues but I've found a solution - island burning. This term was coined by Tyler from RSD in one of his recent lectures and I realize that this is the perfect analogy for what I've been doing to improve the men and women around me for years. The theory behind it is this - the person feels safe in the place that they are in in the moment. This safety is a falsehood because it doesn't match who person wants to become. A popular person, a person with a girlfriend, a person with multiple girlfriends or boyfriends, a person of discipline, etc. If you wanted to be the type of person who walks out onto the dance floor and takes it over, you are in serious danger of destroying that reality by standing at the edge of the dance floor without the intention of joining in. This is where you come in. You, the self aware enlightened friend. It is up to you to make the person aware of the the danger that they are in. There are a couple ways to do this. One is more empathetic slow and steady. Warming the person up with little missions like saying hi to five new people or giving compliments to everyone you pass on the way to the bar. The other is island burning. Take them up into the sky of social interactions and push them out. As in the reality of an island burning, the person will either find a way to get off of the burning island and survive or they will die. How to burn islands Bring people in on ostensibly high pressure social situations - introduce them to a large group and walk away. introduce them to an attractive person and walk away. tap someone on the shoulder in front of them and then look away / hide, forcing the person into a social interaction. lure them to the dance floor, start a dance circle, and pull them in. put in for a karake duet and when they refuse to get up there, go up alone and shame them the entire time until they relinquish their denial and join you. Doing any of these things will put the person in an extremely, sometimes unbearable amount of discomfort - my thought is just like weightlifting if they are able to fight their way through this, they will be sore, but through sustained social engineering, they will develop a new baseline for social action. Or they will quit and never go out with you again. Either way, you win. If they choose to not go out with you at night anymore, cool, you are free to find someone who can take the heat, someone who is unafraid, someone who has dealt with their insecurities and social conditioning. Now you have a new netflix buddy or coffee friend. You need to categorize your people to maximize the happiness of all."
the end,2017-11-05 22:23:00,"I don't think this is the actual end of my hoetry. I do however want to explicitly mark this moment. I am specifically not pursuing several girls whose numbers I got even though they are attractive. The reason is that I don't see how I will be able to move forward with them. I really do value the relationship more than anything else. I need that. I crave that. I want Cassidy. I want to just chill with someone with a personality and have a good time. For the billionth time (it feels like) I have come the realization that I don't give a single fuck about sex. I really really don't care. I am only out here to up the quality and numbers for my ego. On the real, I dislike the shit. I'd rather jack off and do something that is actually important to me. The time that it takes to woo someone you don't even like just isn't worth it. But at what point do you dip? At what point do you have the realization that sex really just isn't worth it with this person. I almost fucked Dara. And I would have if I had had a condom. The same exact situation as Gabby. I hyped up my shit when on the real, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. In the past, I could have been bothered to try harder or to fake it harder but now there is no such will or skill. So I bombed and she did not respond when I texted her the next day. I am somewhat relieved. I did want to close but literally only to stop my streak of no fucking. Only for ego. Girls make that call all the time. They meet a guy, go far with him, and then just decide, ""nah"". I need to get my authentic, ""nah."" on. On some real shit. I have already started but I need a better way to qualify girls other than directly questioning what they have going for them. That is a sticking point and I will work on that specifically. I will craft how to close an interaction with a genuine interest in the girl and the maximum chance that she will have the same feelings. I still am talking to Cassidy. Again, I don't know how long this will last. I don't think much longer. She is a very cute girl and thus makes friends very easily. She literally gets free alcohol from the liquor store. Like wat bro I am a boss ass motherfucker who has a position of pseudo-power at a local club and I think that is the only reason she is still here. I don't know how to maintain an interesting stimulating conversation with her. I am spinning my wheels when she is around. This isn't just her but it is the worst when she is around. Do I even know what I would talk with her about if she did take me up on my request to get food with her? No. I'd figure it out though. I always figure it out. Anyway, I wish my self good luck. Life is difficult but I am almost through this tribulation of ChemE."
God mode,2016-12-05 02:41:00,"I made it. I am back. I was able to capitalize on an opening to enter a group and move from there. I saw a kid do a dance move and moved in to instruct in a way that I knew others would find hilarity in. I fear though that even at the height of my moves, I still was very reaction focused and reaction seeking. Had I received a vicious rejection, I don't know if I would have been able to keep going. A vicious rejection just meaning the girl completely ignores me and makes a face as I continue to exist in her presence. I did it though. weaving through the crowd, abandoning my ego, dancing and gyrating in a way that only I know how. Mesmerizing the plebs and influencing the females with my power. I am unlimited. My friend who just broke up with his girl was able to be introduced and settle in with a female because of me. If I did not exist, he would not have met her and he would not have had the opportunity to meet and converse with someone so lovely. God I hope they get married or fuck or date. That would be validating. And look there. there it is. I maybe throw away the need for validation temporarily for the first few approaches but at the same time, never getting rejected, getting multiple groups of people wanting my presence is at the same time giving me that validation that I never asked for. I seemingly am inevitably bound to get validation whether I chase it or not. Is this a paradox? Don't seek validation, appreciate it when it happens, but remain grounded enough to continue on your path as a man. Yes. That sounds nice. Though in practice this will be much more difficult. God mode. damn. Game has lead me to some of the greatest nights of my life. Not giving a fuck has led me to meet so many great people. I can run a dance floor. My slight west coast swing education has opened up the possibilities in the club that have never existed before. I can captivate that audience with ease. WHOA. hold up wait a minute. I am scared of my ego. I get all of these approving looks and words. I see men looking on longingly with their vodka sodas and IPAs wishing to the heavens that they had the gumption to walk over and do the same things that I seemingly do with ease. I see women moving their butts harder and harder with less grace and more savagery as a brush by, hoping, praying that I will grab them and move them toward my purpose. I walk away from the crowd with the smirk of a God, leaving behind the worship of men and women alike, all wondering for at lease a few seconds, ""when will he return?"" It's the worst thing for my ego but the best thing for my momentum in that night. I was tired as hell by the end, but content. Happy. That may be it. This may explain part of my cycle. I go out and kill it several days, even weeks in a row. Receiving that same reception everywhere I go. I then turn in to an egomaniac and my ego protection starts up. Slow at first but over time, I get scared of the approach all over again. I start to care about things that previously I understood were anachronisms of our time: namely the vestigial evolutionary construct of approach anxiety as it has been termed by the pickup community. I start to not approach fearing that these new women will react differently that the others, thus shattering the God-like image that I have fashioned for myself, smashing the beliefs that I slowly developed over the days or weeks of my limitless, Shooting holes in my crudely fashioned feather and wax wings that had been so instrumental in pushing me closer and closer to the sun until I, like Icarus, fall down into the sea to drown in the negative beliefs that I had built this my wall of action to protect against. I am but a man. This paradox of inner game is where you are forced to care and to not care, to think and to not think, to emote and to logic, towards ambition with no expectations, with intent with no need, and to lead without force. I live in this world with no otherworldly meaning to guide me, no god to punish me, where only my own will can limit me. I don't know why I am writing in this way but it feels right. I could do certain things better and I think about those things after the fact every day. Reminder: life is logical. This shit is not a science. On one level, I can use what has been learned about the lizard brain, the human condition, and human nature to finagle and finesse my way through obstacles, but at the basis of this life, I am competing in the ultimate game of art. This is an art where I have to mold my inner beliefs in a way that when my brain is turned off and I am relying on free association and instinct to guide me, the right things come through. Understanding what I need to understand on a primal level is what will get me to where I want to go. Figuring out what those principles, knowledges, and virtues are is the biggest struggle but as I see my way through these audibles and through my life experiences, I see the same things come up again and again. I will find those patterns and internalize them. I will write the sources of those epiphanies as they come. Really the biggest thing I have found so far is that you must find the vestigial beliefs that limit you. You must locate things that you believe that you must not do but where there is no real reason that you can locate that justifies that belief. Now, barring that this limiting belief isn't the product of disgust, discard it and try to live your life to spite the origin of that belief. If it is a product of disgust, try to find the origin and see if you have a good reason for it. The world is complicated and we need to have reasons for the things we do. We must locate the things that trigger outbursts, emotions, and actions. That way we can limit and control our reactivity and operate a much higher level of power. I want to turn this into a website and change the names of the people in my stories so that on day someone may find meaning in my struggle. On the other hand, that would take a lot of work to make this worthy of external eyes. Maybe next year the plebs can take a honest look into the daily, monthly, yearly struggles of a young man searching for meaning in that which is meaningless on his path to towards knowledge and mastery of human interactions and women."
Siddhartha,2015-01-16 15:35:00,"I recently started reading this awesome book called Siddhartha and am writing this post to try use this text as a lens through which I can try to better understand my life. Towards the end of the book after Siddhartha tries to kill himself in misery because he has had all the experiences and has nothing to live for other than worthless desires. After he decides not to do the deed and sees his old friend and has a nice rest he comes to an epiphany about his life. He grew up as a child. [Here is where I will try to relate it to myself] As a child all I wanted to do was to please my parents. I was forced to go to church every sunday and was rewarded for memorizing Bible verses. The parenting philosophy and the philosophy by which they guide their lives has no basis in first principles and should be perceived as completely arbitrary. In this I feel like Sid, as I strove to be the smartest, best most, spiritual. I thought I knew everything. Skepticism was not a value that I held nor was I something that any of the individuals that surrounded me held. Athought this was the case, I really never felt what everyone around me seemed to be feeling. I never felt the holy spirit, I never felt love, I rarely felt cared for. As I got into college and developed some skepticism, I can look back and see through all the fog of 'because I said so's and the 'because God thinks this is the thing to do's. ""Now he saw it and saw that the secret voice had been right, that no teacher would ever have been able to bring about his salvation."" I love this quote. In my freshman year, I realized that none of the people who raised me would be able to lead me further in my search for truth or value in life. These people based their beliefs on wishful thinking and past experiences which are not good paths to truth. Past experiences compounded with rational analysis of experience by yourself with the assistance of a professional could prove helpful (specifically I'm speaking of childhood experiences that are thought by the majority of society to have hurt but been beneficial as a whole i.e. spanking). Nobody would be able to lead me to a salvation that may or may not exist. In the next explanation of his actions, Sid explains how he dove in to the live of normal men, with lust, gambling, working, greed being until the old young man he had been was completely dead. I feel the parallel here. I dove into talking to as many girls as possible. It took me 2 years from my enlightenment before I lost my virginity and I quickly slept with 4 girls after. I've injested many many dollars in alcohol and started experimenting with Marijuana. Within the bounds of laws that have somewhat of a rational basis, I have completely disobeyed the arbitrary laws of my upbringing until there is almost no remnant of that kid that graduated in 2012. That kid is dead. That lame ass kid who didn't know how to talk to girls, who didn't know how to conduct himself in a formal interview, that kid who played video games everyday instead of socializing with other humans, that kid that complained about his situation instead of changing it. HE'S FUCKING DEAD AND I'M GLAD ABOUT IT. I continually work so hard every day to forget that boy. My experiences will always be part of what made me the way that I am today BUT those situations created a person. The before and after is ridiculous and in 5 more years, my parents, my brothers, my sisters, my choldhood friends, my teachers, will not recognize me. And that is good. Game recognize game. Funny little quote from The Boondocks but it is a powerful message. Other quotes that run along the same pattern are 'show me the people you hang out with and I'll know who you are'. First principles, nonviolence, skepticalness, love of virtue, striving toward excellence and self knowledge are the new Chibuzor. Getting to know random girls on the street is the new Chibuzor. Interviewing at a whole different level of skill is the new Chibuzor. Speaking in public is the new Chibuzor. I am Chibuzor."
always tired,2023-05-10 06:40:00,i can't go a few hours without sleep.i think i'm malnourished. i'm probably not getting enough protein and my body is taking it out on me now. maybe this is the beginning of the end.
What is that wierd ugly feeling,2016-11-18 17:02:00,"I feel something. It is in my throat. Almost a nauseous feeling but I definitely know what that feels like so it isn't that. It's a bad feeling though. I don't feel well. In my brain, I am upset at the backlash against the regulated air guns that I have distributed out on the floor. I am so sure that these folks can do their job with the tools that I have given them that it is pissing me off to the point of physical sickness that they are still non-compliant. I also had sex last night. Raw and uncut. That is the second girl in the past couple weeks that I have had sex with without a condom. This is reckless shit and I am playing with actual fire. I know how irresponsible it is. I need to set that boundary but it is so hard when my dick is out and so close to her vagina. That lay was extremely easy too. These college girls are getting sluttier and sluttier. Or I am just getting better at the game. Probably a little bit of both. Regardless, the actual sex is becoming less and less fun. I don't like rough sex as much as I though I might. It leads to the girl acting way more aggressive and I am not naturally aggressive or abusive enough to keep the girl in check. I think that is a good thing? Vaginas are all the same. I keep thinking that underneath those tight jeans, there will be a beautiful existence waiting to take me wherever I want to go, my personal chariot to the heavens, the new Elijah. But alas, vaginas are just normal semi-disgusting creatures. They are wet and warm and liquid comes out sometimes. They aren't an especially special phenomena in the world. Yet we men will traverse the heavens and earth, spend in-exorbitant amounts of time and resources, just for the chance to play with them. Fucking interesting. I want to write more because I have more to say to myself. After I had sex with the girl, I stuck around. I laid in her bed and tried to fall asleep. I couldn't. Part of it was because of the loud niggas in the living room. But there was definitely a piece that came from me being somewhere where I shouldn't be. I was in a foreign land one where I was not continually welcome, one where the land and sea could turn against and destroy me at any moment. I was in danger. Significant, life-altering danger and the fact that I would put myself at such risk was stomach-able only to a certain point. Don't sleep nigga. What if she wakes up and doesn't remember sleeping with you? What then? What if she wakes up and doesn't remember voluntarily taking her clothes off? She did go home a little bit too willingly... Was she too drunk? No she wasn't. She was fine and I was fine and I would've been okay waking up there because I am an awesome motherfucker and she would embrace me and thank her lucky stars that a grown ass man like me would choose a low down dirty hoe like her. 'cept I didn't haha. We're all hoes out here though. Don't let the well done makeup and the expensive dresses fool you. I'm not against hoes either. I approve and disapprove of hoes at the same time. I approve because I get to have sex with them and the game is fun. On another level though, I know that this shit will leave the girl unhappy and she will not be happy until she finds a man. Not that I am not a man, but a man that actually cares about her, a man that will actually take her out for scones and ice cream, a man that will treat her with respect (most of the time), etc. And I don't respect these hoes. I just want to see their vaginas. And hope that there is something special about the next one. Jesus christ, the mystery that is created by having clothing on top of the vagina in a specific pattern and tightness. Fucking jesus christ. Clothes change the whole vagina game. I swear, girls wearing leggings that provoke my wild imagination about their vaginas is 80% of why I am still in the game."
two epiphanies - taking action and worthlessness,2019-08-22 23:39:00,"Goddamn, I feel worthless. I feel in this moment that I have nothing going for myself. I will go through why this is false at the end of this paper but I want to live here for a bit since this seems the most real to me in this moment. First, the two epiphanies. The first is the level of comfort that I felt while approaching people in Seaport last weekend while on the body highs of both molly and acid. It was interesting to be approaching and in total control of most of the interactions that I was apart of. It was interesting to see and also notice when I was losing control of any interaction in question. While this was the case, in another real sense, I had no control over what people were doing... the best example was the moms in committee. I really didn't have any effect on them and that kind've frustrated me. I had my gimmick of being wild dancing and fun and in this atmosphere, I had no sway and I didn't know how to conversate or escalate. I've has been known that this has been a weakness of mine but last weekend really made this 800% clear. The second epiphany is the total and complete lack of energy that I had after masturbating yesterday and the day before. I literally couldn't do anything for the next 24 hours and even now I'm struggling to exist in public. The main reason why I'm out here right now is that to be out in my car would be infinitely more uncomfortable than the alternative. My level of energy for focus and action is so goddamn low to begin with, that messing with it even this small way that gave me the small amount of pleasure will fucking destroy the world like Mount St Helen Destroyed whichever state in the midwest that it exploded all over. I am stuck living the same day over and over again. 1) Sleep in the car, 2) eat either candy, thai food, or one of my shitty car meals 3) try to get better at guitar 4) make an instagram thing 5) go out at night and hit on women I'll be adding getting multiple 'shitty' server jobs to the list of shit here but differently, than some of the people I admire who made it out of this situation, I have no goals or anything bigger than myself to drive towards. Nothing seems worth it or achievable. Become a famous Russian music artist, get on the Bachelor and become a social media dude that does things, start a retail chain of male romper stores, become an entertainer or MC at clubs nationwide are some ideas. But at this moment, none of these things seems achievable. Everything is at least 1-2 years of grinding away and the idea of sticking to anything for longer than 5 goddamn minutes hurts. My goal is to get my hands on the cheat code of amphetamines in the form of adderall, vyvanse, or ritalin. I am all but done trying to figure out my life on my own without the help of drugs. This shit has been too hard and I am failing horribly. I can't do anything for longer than 2 minutes. I had another job lined up that wouldn't put me in the same place as one of my friends with a path towards greatness in California and the possibility of working remotely. Now, I'm moving from place to place staving off the inevitability of running out of money and things to live for. What the fuck should I do with my life? I'm bored and just want to give up. I don't know how I've made it this far but there just doesn't seem to be much left to fight for. fuck this, fuck everything. I'm really just tired. fuck man. I'm just tired and I don't want to continue in all of this. Yes, this is me officially feeling suicidal. Like I really spent 6 years in school for a piece of paper that no one will let me use. I really spent 6 years trying to figure out how to talk to women and I still can't find a girlfriend or get anyone to spend more than 2 dates with me. Like cool dude, I don't know why I'm here or what I'm here to do but goddamn. I'm going to leave this panera, find a nice cool parking garage and sleep this bullshit off. From there, I will continue to go through the motions of getting better at guitar i guess and maybe talking to girls at night. I at least have some onboarding Friday so that's something. Bye."
enjoy all of the moments,2016-12-26 11:29:00,"I think this will be a short blog post. I was feeling bad yesterday because once again I had tosay goodbye to a girl that I really liked, maybe forever. Waking up this moreing through, I had a realization. I need to, now more than ever, enjoy the moment. I move around so much, I meet so many people that I need to really live in those moments with those people and enjoy that time for what it is: Temporary. Everything in life is temporary. I will die someday and so will all of the guys and the girls that I meet. Some of the relationships will last long. Others fleeting and you will never see the person again. Learn and become okay with saying goodbye to people that you love."
theory of belief,2020-02-06 05:10:00,"anything that you want to believe is true. god is real. you are attractive. everybody hates you. you are famous. Anything that you choose to believe is true. Fake it till you make it applies ot all things. My only stipulation is the following - if you want the best for your life on this earth, you should tailor you beliefs"
back to potential,2023-03-29 02:57:00,"had a girl named skye over earlier. if i had to put money on it, i would say that I'm not going to see her again. then again, i thought that she wouldnt respond or come over in the first place... and she did. but still, this time, i don't think she'll be back. I just find myself creeepy or uncomfortable. I just don't know how to act around women. at least that's what it feels like. I feel like a kid showing his toys to a girl he likes but who isn't really proud of his toys because he hasn't made anything truly great yet. I am still larping as a designer and I feel that I'm not real until i manipulate a basic block with darts and make a dress. until then I'm just a guy making clothes. and what. girls are supposed to come over and actually just try on clothes? How can that be entertaining? should entertainment be the goal? should I be trying harder? should I try less? I feel anxiety.I need to make a lot of things and I don't know if i can do it. I remember shipping out the compers in this evergy and those didn't end up the way that I wanted them to. communicate early and regularly. I need to ask taht girl if she wants more or less room in the sleeves. I need to finish my mormon woman's pants. I need to start making content again. I need to have more women for consistent content. women who are comfortable with me enough for me to touch or do whatever without risk of never seeing them again. That is the dream. How the fuck do I get there though? I feel like i can get there. i know i can but god. i feel like i'm going about it in a subversive way... like i feel like i should go for sex or fucking first then go for other things instead of the opposite. i only really truly want the opposite though. well. it's suppressed. i would audible for sex often but it's an afterthought at this point. I am afraid of the sacrifices I'm making. Will they be worth it? Will they be worth it? Will I ever be in the maldives with a girl that I fuck with chilling?"

done - it's done,2025-02-02 14:41:00,"i'm struggling. i now it all is about what you focus on but man i'm lonely. man i miss having someone listen to my bullshit. and i now that it's only been a few hours. but fuck. and i broke up with her. like. what.and yes, there were good reason s ot break up with her. she disrespeted me multiple times. she didn't have me as any kind of serious priority in her life. she kept many secrets from me. she wouldn't commit so we were in a tacitly open relationship. she woulnd't sext out of fear of the world but expected me to sext. i mean i'm sure i could go on. but i miss her. i think i loved her in a way. i think i loved her in a way. but what is love. i have no fucking idea. but i broke up with her. i broke up with her. and iven in the end, i tried to cycle back. ahahhhhhhhhhah. fuck man. who am i. i literally have no idea who i am or what i want. i vascilate between moods like candy. i can't trust myself. i can't trust myself. how can someone else rely on me. it's not possible. so and so and so. i'm just dissapointed in how things ended up and how they are ending up. i'm sad. it's hard to move past this man. however much i want ot move past. i think i will always think about her. just like i always think about chad. just like i always think about sayora. who knew that i was signing a forever contract 2 months abo infrom on emsphere. fuckfuck fuck fuck fuck fuckfuck.and i don't really curse all that mcuh. but man i just want to roll on the ground an scream. i want to roll around and dissappear. i want to call her and beg her to stay, i want to cry on the fucking phone, i want ot change flights and fly there. but alas. it's over. it fucking has to be over. and i have to be a human. i'm so afraid of going up to girls again man. i just don't want to. i laughed a few weeks ago at a guy that was nervous around girls and here i am. back like i never left.i don't hve new insights. i just see more pattern. so it's interesting that despite all the bullshit, i want to continue. it was the same with mary. man even the temporary relief of returning is worth the temporary releaf because the full thing is just hell man."
Lying. Hayley too,2015-01-04 10:20:00,"It's almost 5 o'clock in the morning. Why the fuck am I still up? Well I did learn some interesting things about my research on exosomes. But why am I really up? What is the true reason I would shirk the comfort and need of sleep? A girl. It's always a girl. Why the actual fuck is it always a girl? Hayley. Well, I made a girl cry today several times. With my words. I haven't done that in awhile. The only times in the past that I can remember accomplishing something so reviling was when I snuck out of my house at night and my mom caught me when I returned. I lied about my whereabouts and she started crying. Another time was when I got caught stealing from Walmart and I had to call home and explain what happened. The last time I can remember making a female cry was when I stole a lollipop with my friend Daniel Hunt in the 2nd grade from my teacher Ms. Web. She cried telling me how disappointed she was in me. All these charges produced a great inescapable amount of shame to me. I was truly upset by each occurrence. All because of my lies and deception. In addition to others, that is a huge contributor to why I hate people who lie to me today. If you lie to me today, you are the 7-year-old me feeling shameful as ever while being my teacher is crying. Fuck you for bringing that memory back to haunt me. I hate liars. If striven ever since to be as truthful as possible in all of my endeavors. In the book Lying, Sam Harris makes a good case for literally all lies being wrong. I agree. Which brings me to tonight, or rather, this morning's events. Girls I meet lie to me often, mostly about why they won't date me or why they didn't text me back. It hurts and I usually never see those girls again so it doesn't bother me. But this semester, through all the bullshit, I met what I thought at the time was a smart reasonable girl, Someone who I could see myself having a legitimate relationship with. Hayley. But alas, my efforts were futile as she explained that she was trying to work things out with her ex-boyfriend. Damn that sucks. Maybe, one day, I hope. Fast forward, she meets my piece of shit roommate, Nick, and fucks him. Knowing how little respect he holds for the girls that he fucks, I was astounded. I thought she was working things out with her ex and that that was the reason we couldn't get together. Didn't stop you from fucking another dude. A fucked up person at that. I'm done. So fucking done. For some stupid ass reason, I held this broad up to a higher standard that normal women. I will never do that again. Maybe if I hadn't, her and I would still be acquaintances. Blah Blah. She tried to rectify my hatred of her because she ostensible valued my input in her life and really liked me as a person. I bit because of that higher standard bullshit. Normal girls would've been chopped to the wayside by now. Instead, I hold on for dear life to this raft because attached to it is hope for a better life. Attached to it is hope for a better future with a new friend who respected my opinion of her mistake. Attached was a legitimate apology for the wrongdoing done to me. I do not believe I have ever received a legitimate apology in my life. Maybe people can change. I was wrong. She just didn't see how she was dishonest. And not only that, she did not see how she was making a mistake with her choice to fuck for alpha and hotness instead of value. That's a train that leads straight to single motherhood, living off of the state and or a beta male white knight provider. Fuck that shit. I will not take part. I pretend forgave her stupidity that day after her bullshit non apology after my best bud Nate asked her to. ""I'm sorry for being dishonest, but also I wasn't being dishonest."" OK. Loud and clear. You are a person who is full of shit. Honestly, I should have stopped there. If I am being perfectly honest, I should have unfollowed her on twitter and blocked her number on my phone. But I didn't. Low and behold, Nick dumps her and she feels sad. But her tweets really just piss me off. They remind me that she could have done better. With me. With someone who actually cared for her. Those tweets are a spit in the face to the methodology with which I subscribe to to understand life. If you fuck someone or you are friends with a person that you know is a bad/evil person, then you are seriously fucked up. Either you are dumb as shit for not seeing that they are evil or you are fucking retarded enough to think that you can change the person. Even worse is seeing that the person is a bad person and then just believing on their word that they are a good person now that they have joined forces with you and fucked you after one day of knowing. OK. Anyway, after all those tweets, I couldn't stand it any longer. I had to say something. I should not have. I caused needless grief to a girl who was already feeling bad. She didn't listen to what I had to say before, why would things change now? But no reason was being used in the crafting of my message or the content thereof. After a little back and forth, my temper began to flare as I saw that old stubbornness against any dissenting opinion whether correct or not. No evaluation of the consequences of your actions. At least admit you made a bad decision. At least admit you misled me to believe that the reason you and I couldn't be together was because of how you felt about your ex when it was really about how I touched you. I do admit, I have changed with the times and I tend to be way more hands on with girls than I used to be and probably more so than other men. I understand how that could make a girl uncomfortable. BUT IF THAT IS THE REASON THEN SAY THAT THAT IS THE REASON. Do not lie and lead the guy to believe that everything is alright and the only problem with the relationship is that your ex boyfriend is too lovely. No lies. I was definitely rude. My texts and call were definitely uncalled for. I might apologize later. But I did mean every word and I cut her off in the end because I cannot be friends with someone that frivolously throws reason and evidence to the wind and lies for the fuck of it. Fuck that. I might apologize though for the unnecessary grief I caused the girl instead of just freezing her out and letting her become someone who says hi to me twice a semester in the street. I should apologize. We will see what I do. Signing off. Chibuzor Ejimofor An Angry Man With Only One Type Of Problem I should see a therapist as well."
for comfort -,2025-01-05 17:14:00,"she is fucking other people. she simply is. i won't even entertain the alternative. there is no alternative. she is. so chill. long story short for the blog so that i can remember, i'm still chatting with klaudija. we did move to whatsapp but in general, there's no idea that i will see her ever in the future. she was in barcelona, she parties with her friends and she's going to paris in one week. she's single. and so she's fucking other people. she told me today that she's going to be going to a friends house so she'll be offline. that means that she's going to have sex with a man. yes or yeslmao, now obviously, i'm being a bit over the top. and yet, it is what it is. the fact that i care means that i'm cooked. the fact that i don't trust means i'm cooked. the idea that i'm typing this blog post means i'm cooked. i've been cooked with this girl from the jump. in general, i've downgraded myself and somehow i think that i can hold a candle to the world of dick out there.nahis there a girl out there whom i can actually trust? yes. is this the one? not at the moment.reasons i don't trust klaudijashe says more with what she doesn't say than what she doesshe never disclosed or talked about her sexual history. with mary and with lisa, i at least knew what they told me and that gave me solace to understand what they might do in the future. klaudija, i know has a high body count and she's done wild shit, otherwise, she would have told me. she's ashamed of her past. i know she has a guy locally that's made her orgasm beforeshe's single she doesn't want to commit (probably normal). she's produced a handful of reasons but in the end, emotionally she's not there. i truly don't really believe that she'll get there with me. she might, but i mean at what cost. so now i have standardsi want to know a girls sexual history. not because its necessarily disqualifying but it informs me of how she's lived her life and her perspective in the past, now and for the future.she has to be attractive (that's a given)she has to have a serious side - like she can get shit done in life and is a leader she has to have a fun side - when it comes to going out or doing something she has ot have some level of enjoyment or sillinessshe has to want kids (2-4)she has to like me fully, like not just the crazy fun version but the day to day chill guyshe should like travel - i can imagine staying home and working on stuff but ultimately i want to see shit and meet people (sometimes)she can't be some timid scared wierdo. fuck that scaredy shit.anyway, that's the idea. i'm unsure of the future. i'm not confident. i don't love myself. so lets see"
living through the past (sayora is so fucking perfect fuck),2021-04-07 22:05:00,"god i hate that sayora is the best fuck ive ever had. scratch that, the highest status fuck I've ever had. and I hate that I lost that. I hate it. I hate it. I hate thinking about her and seeing her face all the time. I hate that happening with lisa. I hate that happening with mary. most seconds I think of messaging one of those three beautiful women and organizing some wild crusade to wine them back.it's illusory. it makes me feel shame. and i want to block them out with new new but i can't begin again. i just can't bring myself to start this process again. I am in the middle working so very damn slowly towards this success with the hope of returning to what I would call my classics. it would just calm my spirit to plunge my member deep into a new girl. fuck. i have this desire, this thirst, this yearning. I have elyse and that's something. it satiates me for a bit. It's a pussy. Its some touch and some kiss. she's my methadonereally thinking about my future though. while i have my goals or whatever, there is also the very real general block of approaching and taking action. it's always been there and it returns with every vengeance when not exercised. i meditate in silence for the time being but wonder when and how i can reassery myself into this world. I don't like talking aobut it anymore. i am getting shut down on these subjects as time goes on. I don't feel like talking about my past relationships or my present anxiety. I understand the only thing to do is shut the fuck up, grind and when you want, reenter the game. there is no other thing to talk about. you aren't going to become wholesome, you're not going to change the way you think in that context. but holy shit damn i feel that think pulling on my heart. it's energy. maybe i can use this for inspiration in dance or music"
ps on kim possible and andrea,2015-10-29 05:37:00,"I almost forgot about these couple important things but I am putting them in a new document of reasons. I met this sexy girl at my job at Joe Mamas and she was dressed as Kim Possible from those shows that I used to watch as a kid. It was one of the sexiest things that I have ever seen My excuse for not getting her number was that I would rather take my chances on seeing her again and having a better interaction than getting her number and having her not text back. That sounded good at the time but now that I am coming to the realization that I might never see this girl again, I am regretting that decision. In the future, this cannot be an excuse I use for not pursuing a relation hip with a woman. 2) A couple girls (different that my last post) were also at the bar that night. Their names were Taylor and Andrea. I have a history with Taylor and Andrea recently became single. Andrea used to be the sole reason that I would go to Organic Chemistry class. The teacher would post all of the notes online and the book taught the material better than the professor. She was so pretty and she would always sit in provocative positions that would make me wonder what her vagina looked like. That is my new general interest. What do these different women's vaginas look like? I am probably more interested in that than the sex. The reason for that might be that growing up it sexuality was taboo and when ever I did find out about sex and vaginas I had to keep it hidden. Ahh nmv I don't know what that has to do with this. Anyway, other than her vagina, we would have long conversations about nonsense and I would love to here her take on what ever shit was going on. I remember sitting for a whole semester daydreaming about her wishing I would be one of the privileged individuals to be in her life and have conversations with her. I almost forgot the time that my best friend Nathan chased after her and asked for her number. I never had the balls to do that. Man, I really haven't gotten to appreciate who I am now and who I have become. I have become the man that I used to dream about. I do see myself slowly backsliding. This is probably temporarily necessary in order to get better grades. But this is probably not a good excuse, and I do not want my game to get like my body did after 4 years of not lifting. The roses smell good. Anyway, Andrea recently became single. I think that I will send her a text soon or give her a call. I don't know how to have a long term romantic relationship with a woman but I will try here first. My move will be to hang out with her platonically for awhile and then ask her out on a date. 3) Also, I hate the arrogance of women who have rejected guys. Listen, clearly, you were not direct enough or he wouldn't still be after you. If the guy is still clingy, block him on all social media and block his texts and calls from reaching your phone. Don't make fun of him for lacking the social acuity to get you into bed. 4) Kim, Andrea.........................................................ehh I think that was the last thing I had to say. ps 5) wait wtf i remembered something. KELSEY FROM MY POSTS EARLIER THIS YEAR IS GAY. what the fuck does that even mean. I don't even know what life is anymore. She was such a beautiful girl. I don't believe it. I really don't. It pisses me off. I won't ever express that to her in real life but that makes me mad. I really did like that girl and she fucked me up. I waited for her and she never responded. She really hurt me. And now she is gay? whatever. I'm out"
field report - 4/30 pt 2,2017-04-30 11:26:00,"Everyone is human. That is one of the weird realizations that you get while being out in the field. Everyone has triggers, everyone has insecurities, and they are all things you can avoid, take advantage of or ignore. Since I've been in Morgantown for a long time, I see a lot of girls that I have hit on in the past. I have had an impact on a lot of people's lives, to the point where I have completely forgotten and they have remembered to this day. That's neither here nor there though. I saw a girl from my past. Andrea Calkins. She was the only reason that I went to Organic Chemistry 2. That class was way too easy for me and speaking to her was the only reason I attended. It was the hottest girl I had in my life at the time and I couldn't get enough of her. I always dreamed of what her vagina looked like. She would always wear tight pants of leggings and sit with her legs up on the seat in front of her so that, if she did not have clothes on, you would be staring right into the eye of Sauron. Jesus lord I had some daydreams. Well, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend of a million years while I was out of town. I liked that girl so much, I came back into town so that I might have the chance to see her. There was no doubt in my mind that she would text me back since we had such a good relationship (so I thought). I arrive in town and guess what... Just like every other girl in my life, she didn't text back. That was a sad day. jump to a year or two in the future and I am out on the town with my dental school friends, mainly Dustin and Shareef, a med schooler. And there she was. I said hi. Epiphany number 2. This is something I've known but it is good to write it down to remember it. When I reapproach someone or see a person I haven't seen in awhile, I get one of three reactions. The first is that they don't remember me. This is the least common. The second is one of joy and ecstasy. this is the reaction when guys that I haven't seen in awhile see me again. The third is thinly veiled disgust. This is most of the girls that I haven't seen in awhile. There are a few that love me but they are an exception to the rule. I have come off as mostly creepy to the girls in my past, partly because I didn't know what I was doing and partly because most of them have only seen 'Nice-guy Chi' or 'Transitioning Chi'. None of these Morgantown girls has seen me in my full grown up butterfly glory. I got the look of thinly veiled disgust from Andrea. Oh well, there are other fish, is what my brain says. Still, I'm sad. this is a girl who took part in a chunk of my life who now looks at me with disdain. Sad, oh so very sad. I did get the chance to talk to her later in the night though. It was while I was bouncing around from group to group, trying to stay lit. I was having a difficult time because my handicaps, Shareef and Dustin, were starting to wind down and the alcohol in my body was decreasing. It was a good moment to run into me because of the high value of my behavior at the time. We talked for a minute before Dustin came charging in. While Dustin was talking, I was reapproached by a girl who I met 5-6 weeks ago. I didn't remember her but I got her number anyway with the promise of coffee in the morning. I don't think she'll text me. As I turn back, I hear Andrea saying,""I don't care about money"" and Dustin saying, ""Uhh don't you want to eat?"". I died laughing. This is the purpose of this article. She immediately got defensive and qualified herself to us explaining that everything she needed and wanted, she could have for what she was going to be making per year. I assured her that I agreed with her and threw a few anecdotes her way to explain her argument's validity, namely my tripping through Europe. When Dustin left and I was about to leave, I was surprised by the vitriol and the heavily veiled anger that was coursing through her features. Had she not been reassured by my words? So this is an interesting sticking point. I don't know how to diffuse a woman's genuine anger. I can cure sadness, arguing over politics (which is never serious), unlitness, but not anger. I could see the possibilities that could arise if I could pivot her feelings into love since everyone knows there is a very thin line between the two. That is the next research. I need to find or create a routine to diffuse or pivot around a girl's anger. I know one thing is to just dip. If a girl is truly offended, sometimes minds can be changed but often it is best to just find one of the other hundred girls in the town at night. Moral: research flipping girls anger and it is weird that even the people you look up to or put on a pedestal because of their brain and respectability, are low dirty humans who respond to the same bullshit as the other whores, good girls, white knights, and players. Who would've known? All girls are the same my nigga and don't you dare forget that."
relationship + communication practice,2025-01-16 17:35:00,"i am living through my body. often i can forget to interact with the world but here i am. i'm trying man. i really am. do i think that it will work out between me and klaudija? no. i don'ti think she's in the period of developement an self discovery and really being really with me could hinder that. i think she needs to get dicked from some other boys and experience more ups and downs to understand where she wants to end up. still, i communicate.i think she over-communicated while she was in france. everyday, we talked and now that she's back home, she's showing what feels like a more normal behavior that being, absence for days potentially (it hasn't happened yet, but i can see that it's likely). and to have a partner, the number one thing is communication. if you are having a bad day, talk about it. if you are stressed, talk about it. if you are feeling great, talk about it. etc.i've been doing a good job at this. i feel regretful at times as i feel vulnerability with women is extremely dangerous. still, i participate. i participate despite the stark contrast in the investment. not sure what my goal here is. i think i'm close to the end of it though assuming nothing changes from her end. it's been a fun ride. i really hope it continues but i'm not holding my breath.god help us"
Field report - DC with old friends (dustin & fam),2019-08-25 03:53:00,"I didn’t start the night out too well. The guys I was with don’t approach women at all so it was hard to really be in a mood. I missed out on the first few sets early on in the night. The guys finally agree to hit the place I want to go and I start out with a couple approaches in the line to a club called 801. Went decent, so I had a couple acquaintances upon entrance to the bar. It was a bit loud inside. I dance around and see that there is a rooftop at this place. I get in the line to go further up and do 3-4 approaches while in that line. All of these were just carefree fun talks and dances. Not much premise or vibing at all, just trying to make friends. At this point, all the guys I came out with decided to go home because they were tired. All good, I am pro at going out alone. Once I got upstairs, I looked around for a place to make friends and settle in. There was a small dance area up stairs so I grabbed a drink and vibed with the group, introducing myself to everyone and getting the lay of the land. First REAL set: Saw an Asian leaning against the wall. Opened. Went well. From Mongolia. I did a really good job vibing and getting to know her while establishing her logistics. Unfortunately this was one of her last nights in DC. She was responding really well so I grabbed her hands and started dancing with her a bit. She opened up quite a bit and danced facing me. After 5 or so minutes of dancing I asked her to come to the bar with me. She complied though she said she didn’t drink. When we got to the bar she mentioned there she wanted to find her friends. I didn’t want to follow because I thought that would be too needy. She disappeared and I didn’t get the chance to close anything. • Hindsight - I could have stayed with her and met her friends (obviously) • Since she didn’t seem as comfortable in that clubby environment, I could have seeded a quieter place nearby earlier on... Anyway, after she left, I did a blonde set by the entrance. I opened with something about how hard it was to get drinks. That went well. she danced with me a tiny bit by the entrance but it was a bit awkward. Couldn’t find the next escalation from there. Went to meet her friends one of which was a monstrous mixed dude... that’swhere she kinda froze me out and I was a bit uncomfortable reapproaching because of that dude. Then the Germans. 3 girls, all dtf by my estimation. I had seen them way earlier and could tell that they had been waiting to dancing with me. One in particular was crazy interested and was very aggressive in getting me, grabbing me and pushing me against the wall. She seemed extremely inexperienced though despite the aggressiveness because once she pushed me to the wall she didn’t really do anything sexy or fun, she just stood there. There was one with a Bob haircut that was crazy cute but needed much more work. I could tell she liked me but I couldn’t really feel how to escalate with her. So I went with the easier ‘aggressive’ one. At this point the bar closed. I checked for logistics (a bit late I know) and found out that two of the germans were sisters and they were staying with their parents... lord lord that is bad as I had no place to pull because I’m living out of my car and none of my DC friends were answering their phones. I tried to move the whole group to the gay bar and was successful... unfortunately that bar was closed. Outside the gay bar was when my girl grabbed my face and really kissed me. We kissed for 5-7 minutes before the Bob haircut girl led us to a nearby street corner where some black people were bumping music. We ended up dancing there for a good 15m with some on and off makeout seasons. I decide to go for a Hail Mary that has worked for me in the past. I get my girl’s instagram and tell her to text me when she gets home and everyone is asleep. “I’ll come pick you up and you can come hang out in my hotel for an hour”. She agrees. 30m later I arrive at her place and her and her sister are waiting for me. Her sister is extremely upset that I was there and did not want my girl to come with me. I ended up making out with her in front of the house for a bit before convincing her to at least come to my car to kiss. After an hour of LMR and BS, I closed. All in all, tonight was messy as fuck. Life is way way harder when you don’t have a place to take girls.. but hey gotta deal with the cards you’re dealt. Lessons • I shouldn’t give up on sets so liberally. If I did good work, stay in till the end... If I would have done what I did with the German with one of the earlier girls, I probably would have been more comfortable at the end of the night lol • I don’t really qualify on purpose. I would consciously try telling girls reasons I like them and see if that makes connections deeper. Hmm and I realize after writing this that I don’t really know what else I could improve... I feel like I mostly go out, dance around, vibe, and see what happens. Maybe I could try to dig deeper and try to get more technical with my game, specifically with understanding better where I am in any given interaction."
real quick insight on kelsey and olivia boots,2015-03-10 06:22:00,"One quick parallel that I see between my relationships with these two beautiful girls is that I moved very quickly. I went from just fun kissing and messing around to relationship status very fast. From my conversation with an old girlfriend, Jessie, I have come to this new insight. Jessie has been 'talking' to the guy she is currently with for the last six months. 6 MONTHS! That is almost incomprehensible to me. My new goal is to somehow extend my interactions with a girl to longer than three weeks before attempting a dress-up traditional date, if ever. My hypothesis is if I move slower with future girls, then they will be more willing to enter into serious romantic relationships down the line. I know that I would want an open relationship until I find the right woman and a closed relationship with that woman in order to have a stable environment to raise children in. BUT. I don't know if the latter type of woman even exists in this day and age. I will be attempting to broach this topic with Olivia the next time I see her. I don't think that she will be very much help as girls find it very difficult to hurt other people's feelings and will suspend truth or not respond rather than explicitly hurt the person. Stay tuned for updates. Tangent... my experience is that girls know that they will hurt feelings and, since they perceive lying as better for them in the short term, they usually indulge. For me, truth definitely hurts more than the lie initially. The positive thing is that truth contributes to my self-knowledge and growth as a person. I would therefore rather a girl tell me I'm ugly, too aggressive, too forward, too touchy, too unshaven, too promiscuous, too serious, too 'creepy' (I don't like this word, but I have found ways to interpret it so that it actually means something), etc. Just in case any wom[e]n ever read this ;)"

jan 29 2021 - mar 28 2021 chi and mary's marriage ended unofficially today,2021-03-29 09:15:00,"I am out of the marriage. I had a conversation with mary yesterday on the phone and at the end of it we didn't have a relationship. the conversation went as follows. We were textingbasically two days ago we had a big argument discussion where i told her I didn't want ot do this but at the end gave up. I opened the discussion yesterday morning with this nice thing saying sorry then immediately asking her to do some only fans shit with me for money. she responded that she would think about it because she had been to therapy and didn't think that it would be a good idea to stay together. she then tried to talk with me on the phone. it was around this time that jack had picked me up and I was in the car complaining to him or telling him a little about what was going on. and then she tried calling. I didn't answer but with jacks advice that this was just some evil that I know I have to do (break up with her), I called her back.I immediately broke down in tears several times and just told her that we couldn't be together. she cried a tiny bit but bounced back with the quickness with a conversation that we could still be friends and we could go through therapy together talking all the way and at the end of all of this we could be friends and just live our lives together. It was nice. I was so against the idea of being together though.I just didn't like the idea of lying ot friends and family for this friendship. It hurt me to think of doing this. Now, in this very moment as I'm writing this out, fuck, I feel rough rejecting someone's companionship like this. she's such a beautiful sould and I do appreciate the moments that we spend together. It sucks. But I know I didn't want to think about living with someone, lying to the government or lying to friends and family in the upcoming months for the reason of some smalle solace in having a partner through the therapy. I hate that that fels like the truth but that feels like the truth. I didn't want her. I want her and don't want her at the same time. It's such a fucked paradox and because of that I preferred and prefer to push her away and extricate myself form the egotistical fucked morass of what it means to be in a relationship with me at this moment. she shouldn't have to deal with this. She shouldn't plan anything else around me. no one should. If i could break up with my jobs I would. fuck all this shit. it's rough. but here we are.we ended the call with her telling me that it seemed like I had just contacted her being nice this morning because i wanted something i.e. the sex business thing. I said fuck yeah it does seem that way. and she said okay then lets just go back to this nice thing that I said earlier about mutually pursuing therapy with the goal of living together and expressing together in the future and I tiredly said yes I'll tell my therapist that want to do something that I don't want to do (or something like that) and she was finally like, okay I'm done I can't listen to this anymore. and I said I'm sorry and she said don't be. and I said I should be, I don't know why I would put you through all of this. I think its just because I didn't want to say goodbye forever. and I started crying a bit and she just calmly said, yeah I can't listen to this anymore. thanks for trying bye."
Britney pt 5,2015-08-12 12:23:00,"Hahahahahahaha This girl has exposed so many insecurities in new it's absurd. In my entire lives I've not meet a girl or person like this. I don't know how to handle it. I want to be with her all the time, I want to tell her what I'm doing, I want to know what she's during, I want to know her opinions on Clinton and trump, I want to minute what her favorite African mammal is.. But alas I can't. The world doesn't work this way. It'd creepy and out of line to feel that way about a girl. I'll have to stop. If she responds again I'll have to just not respond. I need to get my shit tougher and really limit the length if messages I send these girls. I need to figure out how I can be comfortable living and have the girl be just an extra perk, an extra but not necessary companion and partner. In my life I've mostly been alone. There's never been that person that would comfort me. I've always had to suffer through whatever I was dealing with. I've become so desperate for something with a girl that fills those cracks. Someone I can just cry into, someone that card about my feelings but also will always tell me what I need to hear. Maybe I'm just idealizing her now that wet are apart. Point is, I got pretty fucking lucky to meet this girl. And I figured it up by doing to much. My goal from now on I'd to have the perfect balance of doing the most and doing the least Perfect girl number 2, I'll be waiting"
"too much to do, but time is time",2022-12-05 10:33:00,"I wanted to make a list of things that I wanted to do and create. I seemingly have a small amount of things that I want to learn but the amount of things to do just seems to be overwhelming. I don't think that I can actually run a business. The process of having a website and maintaining that while also creating new things all the time, while making content, while communicating with people just seems impossible and it gives me the heebie jeebies.Right now I need to learn the following skills- how to make a senator- how to make the specialized parts of a cool senator- how to make a women fringe jacket- how to make a jacket in general- how to make a suit in general- how to add fringe to said suit if that's what I choose- replicate 2 coats from etsy that combined are worth 600 dollars- fuggin embroidery must be learned to some level... that or just pay someone on fiverr but even then, that must be done to move forward- I have to finish the 6 shirts that I set out to make- I have to follow up with people which I am horrid atyehI mean it's a lot of shit and I'm only touching the tip of what there is to create.I do think there is a huge gap in the market that could be filled when it comes to cotton spandex woven fabric.

44 - savannah from liberty hotel,2018-11-19 18:09:00,"Small vaginas are the bane of my existence. Well, that's a bit dramatic but I dislike them a lot. With this girl I had the plan of going ham all night and truly giving her a good fuck but honestly she's fugging boring. Small vagina not personality, what am I supposed to do with that? To be fair, my interestingness took a dive on the way home. That's the feeling of going to have sex with a human you have no connection with. and goddamn she was a bad kisser. Reminded me of a goddamn fish the way she was groping my mouth with her own. Annoying. The girl I was with earlier in the night was better but it fell apart after I pressed her for why she didn't like hte city that I lived in. She said she hated Waltham because her father killed her mother and then shot himself in Waltham. Which is the most horrific thing that you can hear on a night out on the town. I wasn't able to truly recover from there. I'm not sure what the other dude was telling her but I would have given some money to fly on the wall that conversation. Kinda annoying to lose to a random white dude two weekends in a row at the same venue. As spoken about in the last post, I have a bad habit of leaving sets too early and when another guy comes in off of the buying temp. that I created, I don't know how to recover. Sticking point - recovering girls that I leave early or recovering sets that another dude has come in on in my absence. Other than that, I officially made it to the inner inner circle of the Boston RSD. It didn't take too much work and all I needed to do was act a bit extra and be the life of the party when necessary. The life of the party mode isn't the best for gaming girls but it is magic for men. Good weekend all together. There was a moment of weakness at the beginning where I was really missing the old flame that I had with tanner gresham. damn she was a wonderful spicy human. I would like to hang out with her again before I leave but I know that optics of that and I know that I've already left and she's already moved on. Drop it, it's literally not an option. Enjoy the feelings that were generated"

irresponsible - things that I have lost/had stolen,2019-06-18 19:46:00,"Shampoo toothbrush Toothpaste Loofah Protein Powder 2 cans of preworkout a waterpik Gilette razor all of my combs and picks (at least 5) most of my shorts (at least 4 gone) 1-2 towels All of this happened because i left my gym bag outside of my car last night. Why would I do that instead of putting it in the trunk or the backseat? Beats me. I have no idea. It is dumb and makes sense on no level. I spent a lot of money getting that bag and outfitting it with the gear necessary to live out of it. Now it is gone. I am upset but at this point I kinda expect this from myself. I expect a giant stupid fuckup that makes no sense that will force me to adjust my life to this new shitty circumstance. This is par for the course for Chi. Why? I don't know. I didn't lock my car in the past and that ended with me getting my diploma, several iPhone chargers, many many business cards, and some debit cards stolen. I didn't lock my car again and got my camera stolen. I couldn't wait to get my battery charger so I left my front car cover off which then proceeded to fly up and break my mirror. I missed 3 flights and one bus in the same 24 hours. I don't have my clear pair of glasses because I can't keep them on my face.. those were $300 but more like $5 or 600 without insurance. Jesus Christ and all of this is in the last 3 months. There are undoubtedly more things to put on this list but fucking hell man. I just can't get my shit together. Fuck"
my problems,2021-03-06 19:55:00,
I quit women on 6/1/17,2017-06-06 08:36:00,"I quit Hello. This is my first post in a minute. I had a hard crash a few days ago while I was in Boston. I got the point where I literally couldn’t walk around the city without feeling like shit. Seeing girls brought me further and further down. I got more and more depressed with every failed interaction and every lost opportunity. I’ve got the point where every girl I passed and didn’t talk to put me into a slight depression since I wasn’t living up to the standard that I had set for myself. The expectations that I had and the weight of the achievements of those around me were weighing down on my with every interaction. Combined with, my desperate want to get a new relationship that actually lasts… in fact, this specifically, I feel reverted me back to my roots. My pussy bitch version 1.0 who had no clue, no idea how to speak. I’ve decided to take a break. I need to break off from sexual relationships. I have an unhealthy relationship with my own sexuality and the more I pursue this drug the more needy and bad it gets. It’s culminated so many times in the past 6 months, I’m surprised this didn’t happen sooner. I was good for a few days then today I considered and even started driving south to a place where there was a girl. The last girl that I had sex with actually. She sent me a snapchat of her in a robe that was parted to reveal some skin but no sex parts. I fell right for the thirst trap and lost the game. I didn’t beat myself up about it though. For a few seconds, there were negative reflections and I regretted that my default is beta. But then I self-corrected and got back on my path. I need to start following more of the Buddhist Monk’s teachings. His lessons are what I need to bring true healing to that neediness, that craving for sexual and physical contact from women. I need the meditation and I need to find a way to lessen that craving and the onset. According to the man, the desires never fully go away. I am human and at some level I cannot control my emotional reactions and feelings towards events and objects that I come across. But according to the monk, having a healthy view of the negative and positive aspects of desire and ultimately treating my desire for female connection as a necessary evil or as an evil altogether will lessen the control that it has over my impulses. It’s been told to me before but the Buddhist monk said it recently again. Namely, the external world, ‘fun’, women, etc. is all a way to get specific chemicals to release in our minds. We do everything we do for the reaction that our bodies will have, not because of the actual thing we are doing… We do sex for the dopamine, we do jetskis for the serotonin, and once you realize that all happiness inevitably leads to unhappiness of not being satisfied with the same stimuli that created the initial happiness, you see the inherent plight of humans. To not engage in fun shit leads to misery but to engage in fun shit will also ultimately lead to misery The way to escape it is to come to an understanding of this plight and… I haven’t gotten this far yet. There’s a thing they call Nirvana on earth and I have yet to view that teaching. But hey, I think I really might try this Buddhism thing! Not 100% mind you, but I will definitely attempt to integrate it into my life. Anyway. I am taking a sabbatical and becoming celibate for awhile. I don't know how long. At least till August. We'll see how things go. STAY TUNED! Idea – ShowOff@WVU Event on Tuesday or Thursday once a month that showcases student art/talent. Coordinate resources and showcase students that don’t normally get an outlet to show what they’ve been learning."
Hayley,2015-01-22 04:14:00,"Really? you want me now. lol Hayley This girl had the nerve to lie to me multiple times about the nature and reasons for the lack of our relationship. ""I have to work things out with my ex"". This dumb whore then proceeds to sleep with my hot white roommate one day after meeting him. After he fucked a girl upstairs and kicked her out because he thought another girl was going to come over. He proceeded to talk shit on all the women he has slept with. THIS DUMB BITCH. wants to come back to me after she's had her fun. Settling for the second and better guy. Graduated from the alpha dude to locking down the beta male provider. Fuck you. Do you really think I'm going to be your second choice? Do you really think I'm going to crawl back and save you from your pitivul excuse for a life? YOu fucked up and you don't get second chances here. Good luck finding an actually good guy that will accept you through all your bullshit. Good luck finding a guy that will look past all your red flags. Good luck finding someone who you will undoubtably fuck over in the future by cheating on them in order to be 'happy' becuase you don't care about truth or doing the right thing. You choose to make your vagina happy because you're so fucked up in the head. You have no ability to evaluate your relationships other than is the dick good... That shit sucks. I will never be a second choice for a relationship. Maybe for sex just for scoreboard fun purposes but never for relationships other than sexual relationships. Double standard? no. I do think that I can tell the difference between a good girl and a bad girl. My path toward truth and self knowledge has allowed me to enjoy the feeling of sex with random girls without sacrificing the integrity of my future relationships. I never have and hopefully never will sacrifice a relationship with a good girl for sex with some random. If I had the option to go on a date with a good girl I'm not so fucked up that I would sacrifice that for sex with another person who is not good. That is the difference between you and me. I do thank you though. This experience with you has helped me realize some things about myself that I can enjoy myself and have sex and do fun things because at the end of the day I would drop it all for a chance at a girl with values. I now know what path I will take with my future relationships with women. It's going to be an exciting expensive journey but I will hopefully love every second of it. However bitter I am at having been treated the way you have treated me, I do wish you happiness in the future and that you would never again sacrifice a good guy for a hot guy and that you would never sacrifice the truth for any reason."
4 years later - I'm 23 with 23,2017-02-15 08:44:00,"4 years later. I started out on the trail of tears toward the goal of becoming a Casanova 4 years ago. It feels like I've learned so much and yet, still, I know nothing and still make the same mistakes today. Leah Casto slightly booted me today. It's Valentines Day and I invited her to cook dinner with me. It was a triple text but since it was, one after the other, I thought it was fine. All of them were related so it was fine. But no. She said that now she was busy. She wasn't busy yesterday. I can physically sense the reality of the situation and nowadays, when I see a girl struggling to get rid of me because she is too nice and doesn't want to hurt my feelings, I try to help. I am an expert on hints and I know which ones are legitimate. I know which situations mean that trying to paddle up the river will fail. I need to stop caring. I need to be less needy. I felt myself getting out of my head and thinking too much about what we should do or not do, when I should try to have sex with her, when I should try o take her out to dinner when I ask her to be my girlfriend officially, etc. That is the type of shit that will put you out. I won't be out here anymore. I think that I will still do what I have been doing and taking advantage of opportunities as they present themselves, but as far as actually treating a girl how I think girls should be treated, never again. I'm done. I will have had to have sex with the girl many many times and then, EVEN THEN, I think that doing pussy shit like going out to dinner dates will cause her to want to start fucking others. I'm not out here like I used to be. I did well for so long and girls did actually like me. It was hard getting those Day 2s but I was succeeding when I just went for drinks or coffee. The world is a sad sad place. I can't be myself out here. I can't let go and act how I want to act. I can't be who I want to be while accomplishing my goals in this area. Observation: Every single girl that I mentally switched over into my serious category has ended this shit the same way. Every single one. Go back through the posts. Here let me make this list that needs to be made: Names I remember. These girls I distinctly had feelings for and shit fucked up because above: 2011 & before (Virgin) 1. Zoey Vilasuso - sent too many texts 2. Katie Vecchio - never established intent, friend zoned 3. Catalina Saenz - I joked too much and was never taken seriously, and am not to this day 4. Lauren Guthrie - never established intent, friend zone 5. Sierra Hunley - intent came too late and I slid in on a boyfriend situation I thought I could break. I was using an ipod touch to express my feelings via wifi and I watched her reactions to my messages. There was no emotion, just placating denials. She sighed at one point but that was really the only sign of feeling. 2012-2013 WVU (Virgin) - First kiss at Dustin’s place with an unattractive girl named Courtney 1. Taylor Williams - first college number. forgot her name and shit just fizzled 2. Kelsey the ChemE – I tried to date her Fall 2013– moved out of parents house and discovered game (Virgin) 1. Kelsey the ChemE – I tried to date her 2. Also met leah casto for the first time Spring 2014 – WVU (Virgin) - still in pharmacy. This was the semester I bought Theo (feb 15) and started doing street game consistently 1. Corinn the dancer - didn't take me seriously 2. Olivia the dental hygienist - tried to date her 3. Gabriella Smith - intent was incorrect (too touchy) Fall 2014 - WVU (nothing happened) threw massive parties though. Mini famous Spring 2015 - WVU (4 girls & lost Vcard) - BELMAR (the dates were in spring) - street game stopped and I only threw parties. Lost my Virginity to Mixed random girl, fucked big butt kayla, Jaikin, random white behind summit 1. Kelsey Kerr (who is now an ultra-left homosexual) - Tried to date 2. Hayley who fucked Nick. I actually made this one cry. This is another tried to date Summer 2015 – Baltimore (1 girl) - first started going out alone. I also restarted street game. Met kobe and mike and jimmy searls (emmy guy). Fucked Rachel hegeman 1. Britney Hewitt the Canadian Eye Doctor - Tried to fuck too soon and the calibration correction wasn't enough 2. Rachel Hegeman from Johns Hopkins - tried to be serious but she just wanted to fuck Fall 2015 – WVU (3 girls) - I had no girls and almost failed out of school. Fucked not Emily botralik, Kristen schug with the hard butt, new years cat lady Spring 2016 – Cincinnati (6 girls) - Went out consistently alone. Fucked Becca Tinder, Madison the intern, the GE bdlg 100 girl on Corporate Audit Staff, Random girl in Dayton on St pattys day, Crazy loud girl who works at Ocharleys, Rachel nurry with the smooth skin 1. Kristen Osborn the Acro Yoga girl in Cincinnati. This one was bad. I asked her out to dinner and fake made reservations then got fake reprimand(y) about her booting my advance. 2. Vida Komer- never established intent, got weird when I tried to slide in later 3. Gabriella Montaz - perfect execution up until I got her in bed and then I talked too much, couldn't take off her bra, and didn't create a mood 4. Taylor Montgomery – intent fucked up. This actually is one of the worst. Perfect start and execution. Intent malfunctioned on the car ride to Devon McDermott house and everything was fucked from there. I was described as rapey. Which I do agree was a correct assessment. As massive calibration correction, I sent her a 5-minute voice message telling her that I really liked her and I normally didn't feel this way about girls. It took 5 hours to come up with that. Awful. Summer 2016 - Charleston WV (1 girl) - Fucked Emily rector 1. Emily Rector the Cornell Grad Lawyer - perfect execution and pull to my place. But alas I talked too much in bed, did no foreplay and couldn't take her bra off. the pussy was dry. 2. Daria my Russian that I met in Estonia - perfect dance floor game and conversation in the Estonian club. I had her and her friend wrapped around my finger. LMR predetector went off but I still tried to take her to my place. I should have gone to her place and did the bathroom thing. Regardless, this was another case of me trying to date a girl. Almost didn't get to meet up with her the next day because I was trying to do the cooking and dinner date thing. Same LMR miss the second night Fall 2016 – Greenville SC (6 girls) - Random young Clemson gal, random lightskin Clemson gal in the street, random in a parking garage, random rich girl who lived dt, random divorced lawyer old woman, girl in new York that was dry 1. Shelby Friday - perfect execution that night to where she asked for my number. The coffee date was too much of a date. Lost intent and stopped leading when I was at her place. Lastly, didn't text her in advance of coming so I ran into issues I didn't want to calibrate out of Spring 2016 – Europe/WVU (2 girls so far) - fucked girl from the UK on my last day in paris, fucked a girl who was too drunk who lives in my apt - and Leah Casto - this one was only that I tried to date. Feels the exact same as Olivia's boot. It may still be alive but I really think that this was a nice no that will be followed by 'never busy'ing me into oblivion 23. I’ve fucked 23 women (that I can remember). Wow. Anyway, let’s try to be more positive here. We can see a decrease in losses of intent as time goes on. The next thing to only work on is neediness. All of these girls are the same. I liked them all individually a lot and the reason that I met all of the ones after Olivia was through Game. Game has changed my life and I just need to recognize where I can grow from here. Stop caring as much. Stop thinking that these new girls are different than any of these that came before. Marriage is off the table. I REPEAT, MARRIAGE IS OFF THE TABLE. Don’t worry about it. Relationships just happen. Be open to the occurrence of one and be proactive about creating new opportunities but don’t ever get caught up like you are going to meet a girl who isn’t bound by her biology. Don’t get caught up like anyone on this earth isn’t just bound by their biology. You too nigga. Anyway, Leah does seem genuine with her boot but my nigga, seriously, don’t get caught up. You have other girls. You can get other girls if you want to. Do you. Priorities obviously though. The flow of this piece may be confusing since I decided to count up all my exploits midway through. I’ve done a lot of things, most of them not great. I really did go out a fuck ton last year. I can’t even begin to count the amount of phone numbers, kisses, or vaginas I’ve been a part of. Game is a funnel that you have to feed and the reps get smaller and smaller the better you get. I am really burnt out over this shit now though. I keep making the same mistakes or I just don’t have the motivation to put in the reps. Whatever man, just go with the flow. Just Ridin’ the wave of live baby as my old physics professor and track coach, Garth Mock would say!"
Estonia is lit epiphany pt 1 ---- 3some,2016-12-25 12:11:00,wtf Jesus. I don't know what I am doing with my life. I could have ad a 3 some with 2 russian girls. jesus. that is the interpretation from my interacion yesterday. they did not want to see me again because I kilkled their thirst with a fucking knife like a stake through the heart of a vampire. They were hungry african children and I was dangling a filet mignon with all the fixin's right in front of their faces before throwing it in the back of a truck and driving off. Have a larger brain. Have higher expectations. Have larger goals. I was actually content to kiss and go to sleep. Jesus man. You're a pimp. keep it up but really take this as a lesson for where you could have done so much more. ps update--------I committed the evil and sent the second message. She will not respond. Does it feel good? yes it did. I will recover. bye again sir.
The Battle of The Chi(s),2017-04-23 07:53:00,"Nigga Chi: While your out, you should make the most of it. Pull up. Talk. Experience women and what they have to offer. Get out of your mind and into your body. This is the temporary escape that is allowed to you when you go out! Reason: If I didn't go out, I would understand all of Chemical Reaction Engineering. If I didn't go out, I would have gotten a better grade on the Reaction Phenomena Test. If I didn't go out, I would have the opportunity to read more, learn the languages that I want to learn, code, lift, and play guitar. There are so many things that are pushed to the wayside for this addiction. NC: Dude, I am semi-addicted to the game. When I do it, I love it. There are very few rushes in life that are similar to pulling an attractive girl from the club. Very few. Be honest. You like it. R: I like it when I like it and I don't like it when I don't like it. Just like everything else. NC: True, but some things in life you don't like more often than you like them. Chemical Engineering is the best example of this. You like it when you get a good grade or understand a concept but the path toward that goal sucks the whole way up. The game is something that you used to like the whole way through. The rejection, the wins, the Ls, the kisses, the numbers, and the coffee all made the struggle of learning social interaction worth it. It is very recently that you have developed this aversion to the process. Reason: Yeah because up until now I haven't remotely tried cutting it out of my life to focus on anything. I have done this game thing alongside everything that I've had going on my life for the past 5 years. It is only the last 4 months that I've tried giving it up. And guess what? I've been more productive in these moments than any other time in my life. Now I've started to resent the fact that I am going out instead of doing the things that would make my life better as a whole. Girls become a part of that. I have to act out of my normal range in order to entertain enough to pull. I entertain, neg, joke, try to get real at some point, then dip. Fuck that. Be productive nigga. NC: Bullshit though. Game is what has given you every damn opportunity tat you have ever had in your life. You would be nothing without the process. Reason: I know. That is why it has been so hard to give up. NC: Why would you give up something that makes you a better person? Game is everything. Game is working a room to network and impress people, game is the job interview, game is getting the union workers on the shop floor to do things for you, game is fucking girls, game is making money. Game is literally life. Saying that you can give this up is illusory. Reason: You're not wrong about most of this. I genuinely understand your point of view. I am just questioning the need to continue down this path of 'every weekend plus one weeknight' nightgame. It's just not necessary anymore. Like you said, game is everywhere. All human interaction is game. We are on the same page there. If this is actually the case, then I should still be able to maintain my skills by going out during the daytime and meeting people that I come across in my life. I don't have to take valuable time out to troll for hours on caffeine and alcohol to make it. I don't have to suffer anymore. NC: GODDAMNIT IT'S NOT SUFFERING! YOU USED TO LOVE THIS SHIT MY NIGGA. Stop with that mindset. Reason: Fine. Even if it is enjoyable with the right mindset and persistance, nightgame in my life should be minimized in lieu of learning the things that I want to learn. I need to travel down those other roads of self-improvement. I have done the girl thing. I understand attraction and I know how to find a girl if I need one. NC: Sure, you've done the girl thing but you still don't pull on a regular basis. You still haven't gotten higher than a 7 in bed. You still haven't had a threesome (and no the meeting with the devil doesn't count). Most importantly, you can't keep a girl. Keep going out until you figure that one out. Reason: No. I'm done with you nigga. We will meet again but you'll have to stay busy for a couple weeks at a time while I live."
the new frontier : impressing your girl,2024-12-27 05:40:00,"you know i was out last night for a bit. i could see the possiblity of desiring these women. i still don't want it. i can't say i don't want to want it. i feel the possiblity in my body. i konw with a burst, i could re-enter the dancefloor. probably with a couple rejections but ultimately with a win and one of the hotter girls on the dance floor with me... more likely is the rejections but that's not the pointi can see the possiblity of the fun. still. i don't want it. i feel nothin out there. and y'know a few weeks ago i might have felt worse about this. now i don't care as much. but you know this isn't new. i remember all the times i attempted a return to the streets. i appreciate a 2-3 day warm-back. first night, you don't do shit. just stand in the energy and enjoy, no pressure. maaaaybe you can try to entice an ioi and take advantage but in general, sit. the second time you go out, you can try. actually shoot some shots. i think this is when it's important to stick to the principles of going out. the number one thing is that you have to be social from the first moment you leave. it's not a hard and fast thing but there is a moment where it will be too late. the amount of people that you let pass by without saying anything is correlated with your enjoyment in the night. in general. the principle is that there is no reason to not speak or interact with any given person. we are all human and this time is to re-train the body that fear is no warranted here. it's okay to be open. it's okay to express. regardless of my rationalizations, the reason i'm not dancing with wild abandon in the club every second is generally social conditioning and fear of rejection. i don't see the purpose of subjecting myself to this momentary growth so i forgo the expereince these days. i generally don't think this is a place of growth for me.. the specific thing would be understanding how to have a sustainable relationship with going out and meeting people / going out to the club. in general, i find it hard to imagine. the necessity of getting into 'state' is interesting. there is a growth area of approaching and talking from where you are and being authentic. i guess that's what the AI has been trying ot show me for the past few weeks. i've learned somethings and i think i can articulate better but real life is different of course.i'm working on the vulnerabiltiy and breaking the ice of discomfort.i just sent a 3 minute voice memo to a girl i like (you know the one). it's terrible. i can't listen to it. but i wonder what she will think. i want so so so so badly to reach in and unsend it but i need to keep it there. i need the rejection if it comes. i need it. desparately. how interestingyou know, here's something interesting. i want the rejection in a serious way for a few reasons. the first is that i will survive. the survival will be a reminder that i can be myself, enjoy time with someone, eventually not work out, and then continue with existance. i already had one of these with that german girl last month. that hurt but maaaaan this one would hurt way worse. so much worse. man i love the idea of it. i almost fantasize about it. the sweet pain. the understanding that it would bring. yes you can be open but there is a limit is the lesson. not a permanent lesson. i'd try to ignore that interpretation. really i'd try to focus on the pain. i'd swim in it. mull it over, talk about it ad nauseum until it had no power over me and untill i stopped crying. it would be a weight off of my shoulders. i don't have to be this guy anymore. i'm free. i don't have to be anyone. is that what i feel though? pressure to be someone? yes. in a way, yes. it's not because of her though. it's my bodily reaction to flying this close to the sun. my was on my wings has started to fail and i'm wondering how long i have left until i meet the impact of a cold indifferent earthoh sweet painand if the opposite? what if she continues to like me for me? loli mean it's really a ridicuolous statement in my head.. a gril liking me. chibuzor simon ejimofor. a real girl? nah manbut maybe"
2 posts in one day whaaa - My weekend,2016-04-28 14:33:00,"Am I more valuable than my interruption - that is my thought before interrupting any given set/interaction 3 things that drive down your energy throughout the night deciding whether to go or not persona fatigue - putting on a face that isn't you judgment energy - coming out of the interaction judging yourself lol those are just notes from a video that I am currently watching. My weekend. I am going to take 10 minutes out of my day to write this because these are feelings that I need to get out and there really isn't anyone else to talk to. I want a girlfriend. I just want to try this relationship thing. But since I have come so far in the player/game direction, this might just not be possible at this time. I might just try to amass an immense amount of value through general interactions and just work on wielding that value into a relationship. I had a little bit of practice last weekend with the mom and daughter set that I hit at the end of Friday and the mom sets that I did on Saturday. I have an incredible presence that I need to develop more. What more things can I say? How can I further free my mind? What can I do to bring those around me up on that same journey to funland? I want the ability to rally a whole bar around me and get the whole shit lit in an hour. That is not a bad goal and something that seems relatively easily attainable at this point considering my actions this weekend. But I also need to finish a ton of shit. I will get through my noise tests in the next couple weeks. I need to get through my last chemical audit findings and give them to my boss. I need to email someone to tell them where I want to go in the summer. I need to give my other boss a good system of contacts so that he can check up with project owners every now and again to make sure that they are on track. Also money. money hurts. I don't have it. I need more of it. I am breaking here. I actually can't function right now because of my financials. I don't have anything. I am deeply in debt. I have about 2k in outstanding debts from friends and over 6k that I personally owe in credit cards. this is absurd. How did my life get like this? I know how. I got used to the life. I got used to living outside of my means. I got used to living large in Baltimore. I don't get over time. I can't get up. I just feel like I'm drowning in debt and work all of the time and the only thing that gets me through is just ignoring it. This is an unacceptable situation and I don't know how I've let it go on for so long. I spend 20 - 50 dollars a weekend on alcohols and fun. fuck this shit though. I need to climb out of this."
before,2023-09-29 21:50:00,"i feel hatred towards the women wearing less clothing. i hate them because i can't and don't want to speak with them. well i could but i distinctly don't want to. why should that lead me to hating them? good question. i hate the distraction. Distraction from what? good question. I mean I'm not actually doing anything. I am just preparing mentally to go do drugs. but right now I feel bad. it kinda came out of nowhere. I think it stems from knowing that I have to go out and buy some things for this weekend and I really don't want to for whatever reason. then andre the guy I lent the lyft car to keeps calling. I don't want to talk to anyone much less him. I really am being a cunt. I also really hate that I let him use my spotify and now it's litterest with garbage gang rap. I had a really wonderful playlist going and now that playlist is fucked and I'll likely have to junk it. It was called daylist and it was this new spotify playlist that auto generated new music depeinding on the history of what you normally listen to at that time in the day. Anyway that playlist is fucked and it's my fault.I hate the women but I really more hate that I am not an actual god of attractiveness in order to attract any one of them and choose not to have them. I don't even actually want any of these wimen in actuality. I just want them to want me without effort or work and since there always is effort or work, i don't want them around much less scantily clad.I have issues obviously. I was thinking about Daniella today. I was thinking about her and how she made me feel. I never had enough time with her. She was always taking care of her family and never really had time for frivolity. I remember meeting her as that wild random server that was fun as fuck. Man, I mess her. I was imagining her just holding me. Talking to me in that voice she uses with me, that voice that women like to use with animals and babies. I thought about telling my friend Jack that I want to kill myself. I though about what if the result of all this, however unlikely is that I see through the bullshit and actually hate existence and the world. What if these moments in front of this computer now are my last moments of clear sentient thought. I kinda like that idea. I relish in the thought of blasting myself outta here. There are people that check up with me. Ivan, Corey, Doug, Stevie, Jay, Dustin, Jack. The last connections I have to this life. make it all make sense. anyway, i fear i must run off soon. i must go to target probably and get all this shit. i hope i meet jesus. sounds like a cool guy if he reali miss the quiet anxiety of the new. the feeling before stepping out in a new country and the uncertainty of life or death moment to moment. I miss the anxiety before a date with a girl where every text is overanalyzed and all lines get rehearsed. I miss the new semester with new classes and new people and old people. I miss the new apartment every year in a new location and social circling from scratch. I miss it all and I also feel like it's over. It's all over. Maybe murder or war changes things. I don't want to laugh. I don't even want to cry.I want to see things done."
What should I do in my life today,2019-07-03 16:17:00,"I don’t know the next steps to date. So here it goes. I will try my best to stream of consciousness this shit until I have a list of shit to do for the day. I need to cut my hair. It is giving me anxiety to feel the naps in the back and in the front. My hair has stopped growing and the processing of color and relaxing has really done a number. It is time to go down to the scalp. I just pray that there isn’t scarring from the relaxing. Next, I can make more dancing videos and dancing tutorial videos. I can probably pump out 4-8 depending on how I’m feeling today. Do one in each romper. Do one with the short shorts and the black jacket. Pick songs that you enjoy. Add some extra clips in to add additional stimulation to the videos. I can go in and apply to serving jobs. It would be good for me to be continually interacting with new people on the daily. This would make it even easier for me to go out at night. I should have done this awhile ago, but here we are. I really don’t want to do this as it would put me in the position of having to quit in 2 months which I don’t really feel comfortable with. I don’t have much of a choice though as I only have enough money to last the month and barely enough for that. Of course, you have to finish one of the TEFL courses that you bought… this is imperative and really has to be done this week. I think today you should cut your hair and suffer through the rest of the FullCircle course. I could develop my personal website and come up with a plan to legitimately start a pickup coaching business. I have the planning tools to start putting content out, and goddamn it I’m paying monthly for this shit. Easy content is a video introducing a topic and then a first person video of me going over and meeting a girl in the day or night time. I could release an IGTV video every goddamn night. Hoegwarts: School of HoeCraft and Hoetry. Lastly, I could daygame. This is the least of my priorities as it is the least value add. Doing daygame will make it easier to find and talk to girls or people that will fall in love with you at night but I honestly don’t need any more help on that front. I am gold at meeting people at night. I could fucking teach a class on it. See Chi, at all times there is a wealth of bullshit that you could be into. The idea that you should be stuck is absurd. You just need to decide what to start first. Now let’s go cut that hair."
38 - Weekend in Cincinnati,2018-08-07 05:54:00,"We are at. Very interesting crossroads in life. Like always whenever I write to you haha. I recently got a chance to go into Cinci to see some of my old friends. It was a wonderful place too recent and see where I’m at as far as life goes. I am a boss. That goes without saying but it definitely needs to be said. I am a boss and other people are starting to see that as well. You not winning at work and everywhere in life doesn’t compute. You are amazing and you deserve the best.That being said, I was able to pull a girl from the street. Here name was Cambria. She was in love with her roommate. That was by far the most violent sex I have had thus far and, if I’m honest, I don’t think I enjoyed it that much. I mean it was fine and it felt good to get a nut off after 30 days for no nap but as far as anything else, it was empty and I wanted more. I really wanted more. I tried to find more in the girl but there was not more to be had. At least not in the short interaction that I had crafted in that moment. I fucked her with no condom mostly.I want to start screening girls. I’ll need to review my posts to see if this has come up in the past (undoubtedly it has) but it is something that really needs to start happening. As I gain in value, the type of girl that I can pull increases if I increase my standards for what I am looking for. Good energy across the board is something important and I think that I have been pretty decent in searching it out. I may have found an amazing group of nerf gun battlers locally so stay tuned for that as well.Aside 1I am also watching some of the bachelorette and one of the lines that Garett, the winner, said got me thinking. The level of attraction that you have to have to pull off one of those corny two liners is crazy. “I sai... I told you before you make it feel like fourth of July going off in my chest and people say they get butterflies, but butterflies are small... feelings, and their chaaah... you give me like eagles. And you make me feel good all the time.”Aside 2Marriage as a technology. I watched this interesting video where marriage is compared to a technology. All technology has pros and cons (input coffee mug analogy). Have good reasons for getting married if you ever do good sir-talk to a few married people candidly-talk to a divorce lawyer before hand-talk to a marriage counselor beforehand"
It is finished - with no new bodies to report - Russia beginning 2019,2019-01-13 11:37:00,"Wow this has been a journey. This trip has solidified that this is my favorite country to fuck around in. Not only because of the women, but because everyone you meet is helpful to you. They will give directions, buy you vodka and party till 8am. Shit was wild. More importantly I learned or reaffirmed knowledge about myself. 1) I don't plan. To an extreme and grueling extent to where I definitely missed out on many opportunities, I don't plan anything and I don't keep anything organized. I have no idea where each of the leads that I sustained on the trip are. I want to start organizing them but I just haven't started yet. Fuck. 2) I have a sense of entitlement to where I don't feel that I need to esstablish comfort to get a kiss... which is weird and backward. I am used to the kiss being a given and working for everything else. Russia has taught me that there are no givens and that you must work for every good thing that you want to obtain. YOu can go on a date with a girl there, date goes well, and still, the girl puts up a fight at the end for the peck. Absolute absurdity. I have gotten accustomed to something a bit easier back home. 3) It hurts to miss home runs. More than it hurts to not get laid or lose a good lead... to have a girl be super into you and then you do something to completely whiff the ball that had slowed down in air and was waiting to get hit out of the park... fuck that hurts. My though every time is that someone more competent in game needs to come in and finish this. I am a good starter and middle guy. the fucking close has been a bitch. I don't think it has always been this way. 4) The content game will be a long and hard road on my soul. The shit that I have to do in order to maintain my instagram at current levels and start to move it forward will hurt. I know on one level that the veneer of outgoing personality that I feel I put on for the camera is relatively easy to maintain... it's the knowledge that what's underneath doesn't reflect that veneer. I hate that shit. I model myself like a model playboy running trains through russia. How can I make the visuals match the reality. Learn russian. My goals for the next 4 months are 1) finish and launch the website. I have enough content and pictures to get it done and I need t oget that up and established before most else 2) fuckin learn russian. I should be up to pimsleur level 3 by april. I need to really take that shit seriously because you know how many mfs don't speak english"
claudia and play,2024-12-30 03:57:00,"i realize a few things1) this shit with claudia is a perfect example of catastrophization - like i want through whole experiences. denial, grief acceptance etc for basically nothing.. that girl is out there living her life and she probably likes me to whatever extent.. in the end she is oging about her day and she'll interact with me when time permits. meanwhile i'm out here stressing. complete self imposed hell. 2) she doens't take my bait. i often will send wild shit to her.. like unreasonalble messages or random jokes (for example that 3 minute audio) or yesterday i made a joke about CIA or some shit. she ignored it and continued with whatever. and i could see this multiple ways. on one hand and in my old way, i'd say we aren't compatible. like i need someone to og with me on the bait and create this fantastic world of bullshit - do you know what i mean? like sarcastic world building / riffing if you will. and at the same time, i am very serious on a day to day. so i like that she doenst take the bate on one hand. keeps me grounded in a way. in another way, i'd like the texting to be more dynamic and fun and without the world building, it gets information exchange-y and boring. so anyway. i could have her for play or for serious. my brain is gonig wild doing anything it can to stay in control wither by accepting or rejecting based on whatever. my only job is to stay vigilant and authentic to something. idk what that means but yeh"
the first year since 2015 that i haven't slept with double digits,2022-08-24 23:09:00,"The year isn't over yet so TBD on this but we are quickly running out of time in the year.to take stock of where I'm atfor the first time in my life I feel fat. my stomach is hanging over my pants - not in an aggressive way but it definitely is happening. and even with that, my behavior hasn't changed... i haven't started going the the gym more and my comfort eating of candy has continued at an aggressive level. The day has come... my body will no longer allow me the bullshit. fuckIt's too soon... there are too many other things that I'm fake trying to do for this to be the case goddamn it. but here we are. I have to start working out when I get home or some shit. I don't have time to just sit around and listen to political commentary from destiny. i really have to make changesfuckit's fucking rough though. I have become someone whom I don't want to be. I'm scared. genuinely. I don't know if I can do the shit that I want to do. I may be even addicted to the idea of failing and restarting. fuck. fuck fuck fuck."
"Guys, we need to have an honest conversation",2016-09-16 14:23:00,"How many times have we heard this. How many times has a radio host, a tv personality, or your local activist uttered these six words. Okay. Let's have it. I want to why when you want an honest conversation that you start calling people names when they bring up statistics that invalidate your world view and disrupt the narrative that you've been given. Why do you get physically angry when black crime statistics are brought up be conservatives to explain that these additional run-ins with police are inevitably going to leas to disproportionate negative interactions with police. Why? This is stupid. This is one of the post annoying shits in the world. If I was white, I have no idea how I would survive this culture. There's no way. Any that's another thing. Fuck you pussy ass men. There are very few things that I dislike on this earth. pussy ass women (majority) are on par but I hate the men worse because of the potential for growth I see in them in general since I used to be one. Women don't use logic so they are almost destined to that life if they didn't have good parenting and a father around. You dudes. goddamn. I knew it. I fucking knew it. People tell me all the time or they make faces when I say that I can tell within a few minutes of meeting someone whether that person would get along with the real me. Anyone can appreciate PC Chi. That nigga is amazing. I'm speaking about unfiltered absurd jokes, strong political opinions backed up by fact, fun conversations about nonsense backed up by nothing, offensive jokes that are no longer offensive because we aren't all guilt ridden degenerate man-women beings. Sam is the gay degenerate brother of one of my female roommates. I knew from the second he opened his gay mouth that we wouldn't get along. I don't like that voice shit the same way I don't like face piercings. man up. grow up. Well this pussy-boy, instead of talking to me, instead of addressing his concerns about the way I'm living in his house in person, decides to send a text. Okay. Honestly I'm normally fine with that if it is directed specifically at me. But this boy sent this text to thw who.e group. Fuck you. Nigga if you want to say something then say it. That is cone of the biggest pet peeve I have. If you want me to clean a dish say it. If you want me to eat food just on the dining table then say it. Don't pussyfoot around your true feelings when I am right there and available for comment at any time of the day. pussy. You'r a pussy. And that 's what all men are turning in to in 2016. It deeply saddens me. I will go out and make some more female friends this weekend just to prove that this can be done and fuck these small boys who can't grow up and make new friends in a place that you plan on being from more than one day. Seriously. Damn. This is how I would be saying it on a video if I was making a video. My brain has short circuited a little bit and i just curse more when I am angry. Also i want to be as hurtful as possible. Maybe after the pain and personal anger seeps away, you will be able to see the log in your eye, neighbor."
back from the edge,2021-04-16 19:49:00,"I am doing a little better today. recovered from yesterday and was able to have a relatively productive day. Today is better too. I believe that being busy helps me out a lot and work has actually picked up and I'm staying busy by contacting scientists and organizing this platform we are using to manage projects. It seems like everyone else is running around with their heads cut off being confused about shit while this is viscerally simple to me. It's surprising to me that any of them have an engineering background. they act like they will lose their job if shit isn't figured out in a week which is laughable to meironic though that in the same vein I'm being dramatic about making money like i'm going to die if i'm not a millionaire in 6 months lolololand triply ironic that mine feels more true since suicide is actually on the table!I'm being dramatic but that's fun. I really hated hearing about Mary today. I really missed her reasonableness and her mind. The way that she thinks. How I yearn for her embrace, her love, her acceptance. I want her so bad but I refrain. I dabble in the smallest of things. putting things up in the snapchat that I know she sometimes watches. but damn she never says anything, as she shouldn't and I don't either. and we both just keep existing. me, in undoubtedly more pain but both of us in pain in general. or at least that's how I like to imagine it. I know that she's all but forgotten me. the hedonistic life of a young person, going out, laughing, drinking and having fun with people. god i miss it and god i yearn for that as well.this feels like a full scale withdrawal. a cold turkey on everthing that I've grown to love and use as a crutch. women, parties, dancing with people, attention. all of it is going and it exposes how naked I am in the world... how naked I was with these things before and how even more naked I am now without them. I fight, claw, and gnash my teeth through every minute struggling to not give up. It's good that I've gotten into the habit of just staying alive. My chest hurts though. I miss livingIf you're not gaming, you're dying. I remember that phrase often these days. It's a saying that comes from some pickup artist youtuber videos that I used to watch. I really believed that shit. and now that I have none of it, I really feel like I'm dying. Because in a very real sense, with everyday that passes, a part of me is dying. The irresponsible, undisciplined, hedonistic, wild man dies a little bit everyday and I want to go with him. To be alone in this world without that beautiful man... I don't know what that means. I love you Chi. I miss you. I still see you through the dancing. but god I miss the vibes. The nights. The girls. The comfort. I miss you. I hope I see you again soon. I say that fully knowing that I won't. Let me go back to surviving. bye"
Girls girls and being myself,2017-01-06 05:19:00,"When you have one or multiple you feel like you are on top of the world. Everything makes sense. There is nothing you can’t do there is nothing you can’t say. You can give advice to all and you have a complete understanding of how the world works. You love women and they love you. You could give a fuck about rejections because you have it all. If you don’t have women, you hate them. You wonder what is wrong with you in that moment that is preventing girls from liking you. Is it your face, hair, personality, culture, words, etc. that are making her choose the English lad over you? Is there even a rhyme or reason to these rejections? Is it even worth the self-analysis or the situational analysis that I am doing after the fact. You hate women. I love and hate women on different days of the week depending on the country and my relationship status. Alcohol has become a crutch again. I will have to cold turkey that shit again. I thought that I could hang with the best and drink and fuck but now it just seems like I am now taking Ls in different countries because of my drinking. I am not a lad. Despite what I think I am not a lad. I don’t give that little of a fuck. Pause to talk about girls again. I will have one more bitch before I get on the flight. The entitlement that young girls feel toward my time and money is astounding. I am actually pissed I didn’t see it sooner in the Ukrainian girl. I probably could have fought her and won her over it but I saw that this was a battle that I had a decent probability of losing especially since she had her monster friend with her. I will write till my laptop dies. Here we go. At this current moment, I don’t want to see attractive women. I don’t want them near me. I want the world filled with old women whom I do not want to fuck. Eventually I will have to relinquish these bad feelings but for now no. Why do other guys have girls? Why was I not able to get any girls last night? I believe this is what Robert Cialdini was talking about when he said that people mostly choose to be not happy. Look at me, sitting in an airport in Amsterdam, about to travel to France. I will be in sun while most of the people I know will be suffering in the death cold of the West know if I will ever be able to get rid of that feeling of absolute hat and annoyance but I can count my blessings in the thereafter. J Good luck in Nice Chi. Signing off 9:19 am 1/5/17"
32 - I can't stop,2017-07-24 16:02:00,"7/24 I mean that. Every time I see a woman in any context my mind immediately goes through the motions on how it might be possible to form a romantic and/or sexual relationship with her. Everytime. Just happened a couple minutes ago with a young process engineer here. Like normal, I don't remember her name. It was an autopilot interaction and when it ended my brain went through the logistics of finding out what she did for fun, getting her out on a happy hour, and so on. She feels like a nice girl. I really am always on though. I recently finished the book The Truth by Neil Strauss. I am definitely a love avoidant to whatever extent and I am definitely a sex addict to some extent. I continually engage in extremely high risk shit even though I don't really enjoy it most of the time. I consummated the Yaris this weekend. Cute girl. Fucked her outside of her hotel in some field since she was sharing a room with her roommate and since I didn't live in the city. Almost got caught. Condom definitely broke while inside her. Ripped off the condom to cum a second time but I wanted her to suck it out. My dick was super sensitive though so the second her mouth touched it, it was a very uncomfortable feeling. Didn't cum a second time. I apparently got her where she needed to be, though. The Vermont sky is beautiful. You can see the milky way here. I am looking into getting help. Random note on how to influence: Give a command. Say because. Give any reason. 7/25 Damn, I really really do want to change. I really want to stop looking at women like objects and treat them like people. I want to stop the dangerous cycle that I'm on. 12 weeks - OCTOBER 31 HALLOWEEN. No looking at butts, tits, kissing, sex etc. Chill. If you want to form a relationship with a woman, be honest with her about what you are doing and hang out. Have a good time."
39 - I'm kinda over it,2018-08-24 11:10:00,"Had sex with an Indian girl yesterday night. She was very cute and it wasn't very difficult. Very interesting conversation at a brewery before I drove her home. Got a bit of push-back where she told me I couldn't stay over and that we weren't fucking this night... I don't know why this is a thing but it is. Actually I do. Girls want so bad to stay away from that social revulsion / rejection / view that they are whores. This specific girl clearly was fucking multiple guys and even came from one of their birthday parties to come hang out with me. wild. But I didn't like it. The sex was hard, cumming was boring, cumming even without a condom was cool but I'm honestly over that. It was just hard to get the pump game up, and the strokes were a bit trash. I'm not sure how to react to this. Should I stop? Clearly not, just because hitting on girls allows me to be engaged in life. But to what extent can I enjoy this a bit more? I'm in a multi year relationship with my hoetry and I need to spice things up. This has been a trend for a long time where I don't like or don't care for the sex I'm having. The choice would either be to change something up in the way that I'm having sex, change who I am having sex with, or understand and deal with the fact that this might be one of the overrated things in life that I must get over. It could be that sex is one of those things that it is good to engage in for the purpose of engaging in it and nothing more. The purpose of engagement is the engagement itself and the purpose of life is life itself. That is all. I have a sex thing scheduled later with a girl I met last week and a couple numbers that could lead to the same. I don't really know though. maybe I will come up with some new moves by looking at the porns and just start practicing the shit in a way that could bring me pleasure. I've never really been a fan of the shit tho. Jesus, I'm a pro hoe. but only at 39. lol that really is kinda a significant number. that's fine though. The big list needs to be modified soon to include the rest. Bye."
the new rules,2018-07-02 15:04:00,"no alcohol no masterbating shooters shoot I'm having a rough time. I feel bad. My body feels bad. My mind feels bad. I am not having a good go at life. I tried going out last night. It didn't work out. I am not nearly as jovial as I need to be in this corporate environment. I am not polarizing. I will lose my wife Jesus. And i really am not feeling what to do or what to change. It is so hard to take this place seriously. I got my questions answered when I am hearing the boss, the head of safety talk about it. It is horrific and telling. I am not confused as to why the safety at this company is lacking. But that is beside the point. here I am, just absolutely struggling with this shit. Talking to a pretty girl or group of girls in this country gives me extreme anxiety. They are scary and mean. They ""look"" scary and mean. That is real life approach anxiety in the flesh. Even after 5 years of cold approach. Lord. I want a jumpstart."
feeling iffy,2025-02-12 11:37:00,"not sure exactly why i feel badmy guess, is that it's the stack up of things that i feel that i have to do. i feel 'stressed'. i think i was in denial about this for awhile. like how can i feel stressed about a job that's so easy. and maybe it's time that i admit the difficulty of managing all of these chats. maybe if i let go of the ego around this being hard for me that will be the beginning of healing. i feel the chest/neck feeling. i can't really listen to music. it's hard to fully concentrate.things to do:go through chats and update the notiontell ray to @ me if / when he makes deals so i can update the notiondelete and find all files associated with texts so that i can reset the install so that it workscode up my therapy project that's been not working for too fucking long [big]code other projects that have been sitting for too fucking long [big]check alibaba and respond to messages [small]respond with update to alibaba message..... they are waiting on me [small]send teckpack to wechat [big]"
Routine,2016-12-29 11:58:00,"The days when there are so many posts in a few hours are truly the most boring, exciting, emotional ones. I want to create a routine. Maybe a few. Until now, I have been flying off of the hip to speak to girls. Now, I will put something on paper. In order to really do this, I must start speaking. To someon. Anyone. Just start speaking. Ask someone for the time. Ask someone where a good restaurant is. Ask someone where a good bar is. This could be a girl or a guy or a family or a grandmother. Anyone. I really do mean this. Even if it is a hot girl, how hard is it to ask diretions to someplace. If you can't hit her with that direct shit, then indirect it and come back around to a number. My questions for investment: In my country, we don't or do have, do, say, think, this. The underlined portion is situational. Where is the nearest pet shop? - It's so hard to find a pet shop. I want to buy a dog. I asked you because you look like a dog person. end of post"
truly it's hard to justify living,2021-06-16 17:31:00,"Truly.I don't get why I'm doing anything. Literally. Why am I working, Why am I dancing, why amd I trying to do a split. Why am I trying to learn russian. Why am I trying to get girls. Why. I just don't really care anymore. I just do enough to stay physically alive and I enjoy food. I truly want to jump off of a damn bridge and die most of the day. Every dream and every time I lay my head down to rest, I imagine shooting myself in the head and that ending everything. no more worries, no more success, just nothing. Sounds peaceful. sounds nice. these books i read - i mean they work for a time. but eventually my existential angst and nihilism come back in. Do i have complete and total apathy about life when I have girls and friends and success? no. do i have any of those things now? for the most part no. So yeah obviously that's why i don't give a fuck. but truly the question is, how long can i do this probably a long time. but fuck i hate it. wasted 3 whole hours this morning laying in bed. how long will i live like this. and it's funny how i know unhappiness is a choice. still unhappy though. still want to die. still don't know why i fucking still do this shit."
The cycle of action,2016-11-20 06:47:00,"There are days where I am unstoppable. I am god. I walk through these females and dudes like they’re sheep and I’m the GOAT. Hehe. Those days happen probably twice a month. I could last a whole weekend. A whole week. Or just one day. The other days I am inside Chi. I get stuck in my head and am unable to express anything fun to the females that I want to sleep with. This sucks. And it definitely doesn’t have to be this way. I have methods that I have taught other men that work. Go out and start giving high fives and pretty soon you will be a social god. Give high fives, give guys compliments give girls compliments and keep it moving. God mode is a guarantee. But it feels like my monkey brain figured out my prefrontal tricks to get out of the social anxiety that I find myself in on a regular basis. Which is weird because I am literally the opposite of this whenever I am on. I always say, I need to figure out a way to do X. the bullshit is I already know how to get laid, talk to girls, run a bar, be the center of attention, add value, etc. I’ve learned the ins and outs to the point where I can actually teach the shit. When I am alone again though, all my anxieties come rushing back. Sometimes I can conquer them. Most of the time I cannot. Which is retarded. I know there is not risk and that ostensible high risk is actually low risk. Literally to get out of my pain, I drank myself into a blackout in Charlotte and woke up feeling sick as hell in a toilet stall in a hotel 3 miles from the city. All because I wanted to talk to girls so bad. All because I wanted to cheat my monkey brain by dulling his inhibitions and senses to a point where he can function in social environments. This is why I gave up drinking for some time and why that must happen again. It has to be a last-ditch thing to reach for the drug. Jesus and it’s women too. Goddamn I dislike my biological body making all these life decisions for me. I want more control. I spend too much time pursuing this one pleasure. Sex. I want to see the girls naked. That is really it. I just want to see a new vagina. I just want to see the girl naked. I almost don’t want to have sex with the vagina. I think I definitely want a more meaningful relationship with women somewhere. I really need that to be a real person. I am really getting out of control with this shit. And look at these girls that just walked by. Goddamn it makes me wanna get out of the car and run after them. And make their night great thus making my night great again. When am I going to stop writing? Whenever I feel the gumption to get up and take action. Whenever I want tostop being a pussy. I see all these people and I know how to do this. I just need to do it. I just need to do it. Do it do it do it do it do it. Action action action action action. But also the thing is I don’t want to talk to them. My mind is blank. My conversation: Hi. My name is Chi do you want to sit im my car while I caress your hair and look at your bare vagina. Fucking unreasonable. Now I’m bored. I could make guy friends first and merge that set with nearby females. That’s usually my go to move. But really I just want to sit here. Maybe nap. Idk bruh"
the second interview for china - i'm scared,2019-07-10 15:08:00,"I'm fucking scared. I honestly don't think I'm ready for this. I don't know how to teach English. I don't know a damn thing and now I'm going to have to suffer for a week trying to get this certification done and I don't think it's possible for me to do this. I'm scared. This is the best opportunity I've had so far and I'm failing it because I've lied on my resume. This is stupid. How could I forget to change this 120h thing in my resume? How could I? I'm embarrassed and now I will have to work double time to cover my ass or send a shameful email explaining the mixup. Would I be more comfortable if I actually had the 240h thing done? Yes. Is it possible for me to get it done in 3 days? Probably not. Would I still feel wildly unprepared and scared of the expenses that I am not able to afford? Yes. Fuck me. I don't know what to do. I could wait around and email people in this country for 1-3 more months suffering rejection after rejection looking to get back into a field I hate just to make and save money toward my goals. I could take a leap off the goddamn cliff and do one of these teaching English jobs where I go to some foreign place and teach a subject that I've never taught before. Thos are really my only two options. I don't like either of them at this moment but instead of pout about it or write more words, I'm going to suffer on this 240h TEFL. Bye."
lol jacked off on a girl,2018-10-12 17:35:00,"Funny that I truly have been attracting a lot of leftist girls. met a fake marxist girl yesterday and had a hilarious conversation. I talked about marxism for a little bit and she agreed that it was a good idea. Then I seemingly switched topics to selling dirty panties and I asked if she would give them away at cost or whether she would try to make a profit. She answered with the latter and I challenged that based on the maxist principles. I thought it was funny. Anyway, I liked it. It was very good. though lord damn I got hit over the head with the last minute resistance. that's the first time in a long time where I've gotten that. That being said she really likes to fuck with my shit. she would be groaning and talking about how big my cock was (in those terms). bullshit, i thought. so while I was fingering her the last time, I took my dick out and worked one out. and let me tell you... I came more than ever. Jesus. There was cum everywhere. holy shit. She was soaked. It was like a porn. In any case, she was a nice girl. We met at the william ference catering wedding that we did at a natural reserve a week ago. She worked at the nature reserve and I approached her to ask about animal facts n shit. She was so surprisingly down for some bs when I took her out for that drink that we got yesterday. lord she was on from the second that I walked in. I like it. i like being who I am. at this point, i'm interested in having some role models to base my future actions and decisions on. people that live the life that I am trying to emulate."
evil thoughts at 5 am on easter sunday,2017-04-16 09:44:00,"People will one day clash and old fashioned brawls will take place. For a long time women have been able to get violent and instigate situations. We've always accepted it because that is their nature. That is what they are. Millenial women are entitled brats who are the first generation to have gone through the guillotine of feminist indoctrination in combination with the chivalry and values expected of me 50 years ago. But. Men are starting to wake up. We now have fuckboys everywhere. Niggas just sell dreams to have sex. I know this has been a thing for awhile but I am interested in knowing if it has become more prevalent. Nothing gives me more pleasure than to visualize these whores getting what is coming to them. Treat them like the rags, the holes, the trash that they market themselves as. If you dress like a whore, I will treat you like one. I reserve the right to subjectively determine what clothing is whorish and I reserve the right to game, fuck and never see you again on purpose. I want to hurt feelings. I want to see tears. This is the only way we can fight tyranny. In this small way, we can disrupt to paradigm shift sweeping society. I have no illusions of grandeur that I can actually affect anything or anyone or any group on any large enough scale to change what I view as the inevitable demise of our beautiful constitutional democracy. My only argument is: if all this shit is going down in flames, watch it burn with your dick in a pussy with a nice encasing (body/face/etc). Watch it burn while you fuck. Watch the world burn while you rail her out, her screams filling the night sky. Screams of love and pleasure cancelling out every single thought or feeling other than the present moment in her mind. Then kick that whore the fuck out. Rudely. Obviously. She needs to know that she was used."
the life of the party,2016-05-01 21:48:00,"That is me. When I step into a room, I run the place. I can dance and grab ass and make sexy looks all night. It's easy. It's easy to get a girl in love with how I move and how I dance. But where do I go from there? for some reason I'm stagnating mid set and I don't know where to go. If I was talking to someone else in a similar situation I would tell them to lead the girl to the bar. Try to lead her outside. Don't ask her, just pull. If she resists or her friends grab her, deflect and say 'oh we're just getting one drink, chill' or 'we are just standing over there so we can actually get to know each other a little'. My response to myself would be that everytime I try something like this, I get blown out. The friends, the girl, or both the friends and the girl, I always get blown out. I can't figure out what I am doing wrong. My issue now is that with night game I am thinking too much. My body is always in the moment but my mind is churning churning churning thinking about what to do next. My potential is crazy. Yesterday, I got stopped in the street by two married women and their husbands. The two men just stood there while their wives fawned over me and told me how attractive I was. One of these girls even asked and kissed me on the cheek before she left me. This is some wild shit. How can this be? This doesn't make sense to me. I mean I know I look good but it breaks my brain to find out that some girls really have me up on this model pedestal. Contrast that with girls who dance with me for awhile and then have had enough or girls that take one look and say 'nah'. The spectrum is disgusting. I know that women like guys for different reasons than guys like girls and that that's the reason why looks don't' matter, but for some reason, it is in my head that I deserve more because I look good. I look better than the other guys that you will meet tonight and therefore you should stay with me. Just like lifting, I think that I am going to go back to square one. I am going back to mainly daygame and I will use that to generate the dates that I want to go on. Slowly and steadily I need to build upon how I am supposed to be interacting with these people. I am currently in a rut where I say similar things and treat most girls with the same brush. There is no finesse or calibration in my game, at least not consciously. That is what i need to work on and night nonsense is not making me better. It is making me regress. I know how to dance. I know how to be lit. I know how to add value on the dance floor and drag any girl into dancing with me. My sticking point is now back to my words. I need to reestablish my confidence with my words. CHI DAYGAME BEGINS"
Kelsey,2015-03-08 23:39:00,"hahahahah. this is one of the funniest ones. I know better. That the funny part. I know better than to fall for women in this day and age. Who the fuck am I kidding. I didn't know what I was getting into with this girl. I was a mistake. She just seemed so loving, wonderful, quirky, weird, and innocent. For a second, I had hope that I had finally found a woman with values, someone who I could open up to and eventually do the kids thing with. I mean that is super super down the road... I guess that's part of my problem. I start liking a girl and then life pulls us apart. As the time between my last time seeing her grows, my feelings grow as well. I start fantasizing about our lives together and how she would react to certain situations in our lives together. It's such a weird habit. It's full of wishful thinking. Girls just don't want the bullshit in the Disney movies. Fuck Disney. For real. Fuck Disney. I never through I would ever write those words. I've received a lot of enjoyment from those movies throughout my life. But now my mind is filled with hope of finding a true love, some one to be the Gabriella Montaz to my Troy Bolton (lol). Alas, The world is a fickle beast and life is much more complicated than a musical. Anyway. Back to Kelsey. I'm writing this one day after she's decided to read two of my messages without any response. It hurt. A lot. Girls just don't get it. They really don't. ""Why can't this guy just not do this or do this or do this? Why doesn't he know the correct way to act and talk to me? Why isn't he super smooth, assertive, and sexy while being a dick, fuckboy, or an asshole?"" Like for real fuck all this shit. I was so Ready to drop my shit and give her the earth. I would be the best dude she's ever met. I would be such a good boyfriend If a girl would just give me the time of day!. This shit sucks. Anyway. She had wonderful big pretty brown eyes. She was super responsive to my low key PDA of holding her hands and person. It was super comforting. In those moments, I felt like I had everything figured out. I was happy. I was content. I worked for so long, taking tests and talking to random girls, learning new skills, and exiting my comfort zone for the chance to meet a girl like this. My life was coming together just as my grades were falling apart (as a result of my chasing of vagina instead of studying). I seriously liked her so much. She was unpredictable. She was actually funny and had a sense of humor to accompany. I really wanted to take her out and fucking close the deal. Not necessarily with sex, but with a serious series of candid talks about our futures, principles, values, loves, hates, wants, needs, etc. But she apparently did not want the same thing. Some insight was provided from my friend Kwaku, who asked her friend if I should just go for it and ask her to be my girlfriend. The response that came back was, no don't ask her out. She's a free soul and might say no because she's afraid of commitment. damn. damn Flag on the play with that one. Clearly, I had misjudged this pretty pretty wonderful girl. sucks. I went ahead and tried any way. I called and called and texted and texted. Idk if it was that her phone was just dead or on airplane mode but none of my calls would go through. My texts were read without response.. When I saw her in person, I looked deep into her eyes for only a few seconds., reason being that I didn't want to be awkward about her not responding to my messages. Fuck that shit. I should have asked her then and there what the fuck she wanted out of life, boys, and relationships that I was unable to provide. Obviously, that would have made everyone extremely uncomfortable but honestly, fuck that shit. I want to know. When I looked into her eyes, I saw the words, ""I'm sorry but no, this is not a thing."" It's exactly the lingering glance while leaving that you would give to an awesome dog you spent the day with at the pound, who, for some reason or another, you would not be able to adopt. Yeah. That was the exact look. While I did trouble over why she would not be able to adopt me into her life, I quickly returned to earth after the read receipts. Just like all the other girls, her past is fucked up. She has no capacity for the type of relationship that you want, at least not at this stage in her life. Just move on. It's not you it's her. Don't get me wrong, I'm always looking for self improvement. But when it comes to girls, I'm a firm believer in, ""If she likes you, you leaving a voicemail or asking her out through text or etc. will not be the final blow to the relationship."" I don't believe that I did anything that would deserve a boot from a principled woman. Since that is that case, there must be something in her past or present that is preventing her from committing to an honest relationship. Whatever though. there are other girls. That act the exact same. SO AS A RESULT TODAY HAS BEEN DECIDED ON FOR THE START DATE OF MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE GAME OF LOVE AND SEX. This means that for an indefinite period of time I will not go out of my way to meet and attract women. I'm for real done. I can't handle these games. I've played for long enough and I have seen absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to females. Chibuzor Ejimofor out. Updated: I just thought of the song by Childish Gambino [Donald Glover] - Kids. The song basically says if you and I were still kids, our relationship would work out. My further interpretation is that there is less of a chance that the girl has been fucked up by the world yet. There's a less of a chance that feminist propaganda and Disney shit has reached her precious young mind. But all hope is lost when the shit hits the mind while it is still learning and growing. Alas, I didn't know when I was young. Now, all these old girls are fucked up. Is there a NAWALT (not all women are like that) out there for me? Probably not. I have some small small hope. but still - for now I'm giving up. Chibuzor Ejimofor out."
moving the needle,2022-05-17 19:21:00,"man i tell you the self attach in my mind is crazy. it’s all kill yourself shit and every few minutes I imagine a gun to my head and ending it all. It’s part of this self attack narrative of not having a routing, having small arms and not feeling strong as well as not really having a concrete move forward plan to the extent that it feels like I’m doing things for Christ instead of at least being towards some BS goal that I made up. annoying. and I have layers of excuses for as to why i can’t or won’t approach the local women. I will go out this week but this is nasty and not the most fun life to live. Really ridiculous how i have so much time yet I can’t find a few minutes to do work that wil actuallly give me money. I hate that the most… that I have a guaranteed 600 - 1200 a week and I refuse to take it. What the actual fuck is wrong with me. When I feel that or remember that, that’s when the feelings get the strongest. fuck you you actual piece of shit, do the Fucking work that you need to do to stay alive. There is literally nothing else. If you can do this for 10 hours a week you can have a wonderful life. If you don’t, your opportunities go to near zed. take this life more seriously my guy. no one cares about what you want. we care about what you are willing to work for to get."
45+46 abigail the lawyer and the devil 3 w artem,2018-12-03 23:29:00,"Field report I'm way too good at saying I love you like I believe it. I'm way too good at turning my phone off whenever you call me. I only say that I want you because I'm used to. - Sasha Sloan I feel these lyrics but more toward all women. I don't have that same energy as before and I can't do round 2s anymore... I don't know if it is because I'm malnourished or if it's because it's a mental thing but I literally can't get hard after I cum for the first time and even starting to fuck the girl Artem shared with me was difficult. I don't know how long I can handle life in the direct spotlight of hoetry. I like the idea of creating a brand like hoegwarts or hoetic justice and putting it out to the masses for some of that internet money. I have better game than a lot of the dudes that we see on the internet... though there is a lack of shit in my brain to move the interaction forward as at this point I'm relying on the instinct of the situation. I closed a lawyer... didn't really fuck her hard but I put it in and dabbled. She was wonderful and I really enjoyed spending time with her. It is the small shit now. The callbacks to earlier conversations. The fact that the girl actually remembers that things that I am telling her and the jokes that I make. The fact that she kisses my neck and rubs me when we cuddle pre-sex. I am here for that way more than anything else. I like that. Even if she isn't the most attractive thing I've pulled, she's cute and she has a good butt and personality. I can look past a big forehead for the other things. And that is one of the things missing from the discussions that I have with Dustin. It seems him and to a lesser extent, I, are looking for this mythical beast of a girl with the personality of a 6 and the looks of a 10. If a girl really is that attractive, she most likely hasn't had to develop a personality for people to like her... everyone already accepts her because of her looks. High respect for people with model attractiveness or that come from money that still make something of themselves... It is hard to have motivation to do shit even as a normal person when you have the evolutionary drive to survive and become more successful much less when you already have money, success, and the people that you want to have sex with. Abigail. She was a cool girl that met me on the street... actually one of my new acquaintances, a black dude in RSD called Michael or some variant, approached her and I jumped in and convinced her to come out for a drink with us. She cam out and she ended up being more attracted to me because I was focused and channeled toward her where Michael was a bit too drunk. I really enjoyed the next 12-15 hours or that life. Spending the night with her in that bar, jumping to the next bar, kissing there, going to my car, getting mostly naked, mostly fucking but not, then going back to my place fooling around culminating in a couple pumps, and cuddling and sleeping together all night.. wonderful. She didn't want to have sex at first and for most of the night. She contrived the BS thing where she was like, you can fuck me but if you do, you can't see me ever again. And I obviously value relationships more than that so I fell into that frame. I really didn't know how to escape that shit test so I went along with it with the hope that as what normally happens, I will be able to spike the attraction enough for her to want to fuck me regardless of her weird rule. Didn't work but I left it alone for the most part because my brain has been and currently operates on this slightly safe side because of the fact that I am aware that people often feel afraid to say what they actually think and her actual thoughts could be that she really doesn't or didn't want to fuck. I don't like that so I try to operate on the safe side. She says that she is all about the deferral of gratification which is a beautiful term that I value and also despise since I've been operating on the quick quick for a long time. Still, I hope to see her again once her finals finish. I don't know how I will break it to her that I will be leaving the are after the week that we potentially spend together but I will find a way. It will most likely be the BS excuse of my company is randomly transferring me across the country. ""I fucking like you and I want to continue this but this is happening. Can you please get an Instagram so we can keep up with each other. The best snapshots of you life up there are something that I would really enjoy. "" The second part of the title of the post is that artem shared a girl with me. It was a cool thing. He talked to the girl that he was fucking ans was like, yeah, if you want to fuck Chi, let's do it. And damn. He really gives it to her. He was doing some porn shit with his fingers and like not letting her cum and doing a lot... I have never talked dirty or anything so that would be a new place where I could go to expand my life. Talking dirty and using tools to get the girl off. esp. when my actual sex drive seems to be getting lower and lower. I learned a bit. Tbh I'm going to leave here and look up how to talk dirty though god damn it feel like that will be a lot like singing in that it will take concentration while living in the moment, technique, and letting go all at the same time. Just like with everything, if I care about how it is going to sound on the front end, that will prevent me from doing the action. It really is a mental thing to be free from the outcome for as long as you need to be in order to get the outcome that you want. and you really do have to be mentally free of the outcome. Ultimately, the purpose of the exercise or cold approach or anything in general is the goal of sleeping with more women, having better relationships, singing better in front of more people,etc but on the front end, thinking about sounding good will not help me. I need to focus on technique and let what arises out of that arise.It is a purely mental exercise that will highly impact how you end up performing in the end. (more work related) I don't have much to say other than other people are right and also forever to give me honest feedback and when I receive honest feedback, I have been twisting it in my mind with the emotion of the situation till it reflects some bastardized form of what is trying to be communicated to me. It isn't what you say, it's how you say it. I have worked very hard to remove my filters and through that process, my corporate bullshit has suffered since the filter of bullshitting about how good things are or re-framing negative things to lessen the hit on other people's egos is the opposite of how I've been gaming. fuck. I know that I am perpetually incorrect on a lot of shit and that I to rely on myself alone to bring the truth out of myself and to encourage the environment around me to be that where everyone feels comfortable saying what they feel about the situation. The Ray Dalio book that I read earlier this year really went through and detailed how he created that culture around him and how difficult it was to maintain through time. Jesus and I can see how that is the case. That being said, he didn't give up and now he is the head of one of the biggest hedge funds on the planet with a happy wife, kids and the whole 9. Push through the bullshit my friend. I know things can seem bullshit at times but that is where this blog and the voice memos come it. I am here for you to unload all your thoughts and feelings onto and into. You can't keep or continue unloading all of your real thoughts and feelings into the world. People can't handle direct exposure to real shit. If you haven't learned that by now then damn if you didn't learn anything in those years at GE. Be better. Follow up on those Instagram leads diligently. I'll talk to you later. I love you."
my official opinion on read reciepts,2019-09-02 22:24:00,"I love read reciepts for several reasons. They can create discomfort in other people leading them to double text, triple text, or otherwise take initiative in an interaction that I am generally leading. I welcome any chance to relinquish this social responsibility. They force me to respond to messages quickly instead of stewing and creating the perfect response. The thing I should be doing is trying to express myself in as few words as possible towards my goal of meeting up in the future. A lot of messages contain information but don't require a response. In those cases, the person sitting on the other end of my messages can rest easy knowing that I have received their information. Some messages are petty, rude, or completely unreasonable. If I receive such a message, I want the person to know that I read their absurd message and that I will not be responding. It's that simple. The pushback I normally get is people saying that they don't want people to know what they are up to. And to that I say fair enough. But as humans under 40 in 2019, I also know that every message that I send is immediately seen by you since you always have your phone in your hand or on your person. We are all addicted to our smartphones so if you want me to honestly think that it took you 5 hours to respond to my simple question, nah. I don't get bitter about people not texting back anymore though. It's part of the game. It's part of life."
72 - the NYE morgantown tinder,2020-01-02 20:21:00,"This one was really fun and surpisingly good pussy. I started the night with Jack and friends at their house. There was a shit ton of alcohol but I swear alcohol doesn't do shit to me under massive quantities. Many of the people that wer were with were consuming massive amounts of the stuf... alex hispanic almost drank a whole damn bottle of crown green apple. we went downtown. when passing joes I saw my old love emily kennel. so interesting that I didn't care that much. then I saw white nate in the same line. he was looking great. we kept walking and went to 4th and goal first. there wasn't much there but still did a few approaches. pushed jack to follow me on some girl who had a captain america looking purse. she wasn't very cute or interesting so that got dropped quickly. I saw brian lasure and evan hamilton there too. that was cool. cassidy was working. gave her a hug (that she asked for). no biggie. it was wierd tho. it was just a formality that she really wanted to go through... like asking someone how their day is going while checking out at the supermarket. forcibly made everyone leave that place around 11. walked down to code, but there was a line out the dick. went to backdoor instead where we rode it out till NYE. it was cool to just chill with all my friends specifically jack and nick instead of wilding. barker, one of jacks friends, pressed me to approach a 3 set, 2 bigger girls and a dude. I went in a bit and joined in hyping their jenga game. left immediately after the one girl lost. there was a 2 set at the bar. they were opened by someone in the group and we interected with them throughout the night. turns out one of them was engaged and one was single. the single one wasn't bad and she liked one of the guys that jack brought with him from cleveland. There was 2 attractive girls there, both with guys. I saw one of these girls isolated looking through the free merch that was at the front of the bar. I rolled in (with jack) and said stuff. she left pretty fast though it wasn't a bad interaction. cordial. i convince jack to don one of the tanktops with me and we cavorted around the bar in these things for the next few minutes. I got bored and convinced most of the group to go to joes. i paid for jack. we rolled in and I immediately started talking to people. I saw jack wasn't fuck I don't really want to write the rest of this so I'm going to shorted the fuck out of the night. Long story short, I saw a whole bunch of MFs from high school one of which was dave smith. dave is a mini me in that he is a good looking smart young hype man like myself. we rolled around all night doing good shit. we had a couple girls on the main dance floor toward the end of the night. they dipped and I just got a snap. the whole night I had been messaging this girl from tinder. she was at 4th. I followed the dave 2 set with dave to lotsa and tried to see how warm the pull was. it was not warm. it would be a fight. so I dipped to 4th and bought two of my high school friends drinks. I found the girl after. she was cute small and thick. we talked. a fight broke out among the black people at the bar. we left with her friends. we went to one of the friends places where we took shots and ate food. we kissed a few times while there. she asked if I had a place and I said yes. we left in an uber and I said that I might not have a place because of some made up shit (I was staying withe my parents and tried to pull to jacks). I pulled to jacks and left her in the car while I checked the status of the rooms and living room. not good, everything was occupied. I came back to the car and she said that she couldn't have sex with me. I said cool lets just kiss. we kissed and then she climbed over to my side of the car. keep in mind that we are parked right in front of jacks place on a main residential road. cool. bagged once. her pussy was fantastic. I used the pull out method. I should get checked for bugs soon. bye."
we still talk + my dick is wierd,2025-01-16 14:37:00,"man i had something the other day.. like rasor bumps. i have kinda had something like this before. kinda like if you shave and there's a bunch of ingrown hairs. so that happened at the top left base of my dick. i couldn't handle seeing it so i popped the zits. now they are kinda open wounds. i think it's been like this for a week maybe 2? i'm scared. my lymphnodes were swollen a couple days ago and hurt. the wounds kinda show signs of infection sometimes. i remember when i fell years ago in a football game and i got rugburn. i remember going to the nurses office and her scrubbing the scab off because she said it was infected. i remember how that looked. anyway, i make sure to keep the wounds clean. they fill with zit fluid daily and i squeeze it out. so anyway, i feel nasty and fucked up. can you imagine if i had a girl right now? man that would be fucked up. so idk. i think i should get it checked. but it feels better to not know. i remember when i found out i had the mouth herpes. that was fucked. and a few months ago, i had another ingrown hair that became a sore on my dick but i fucked and the girl didnt' get anything so it was truly just that. i'm like 90% that it's nothing but still. i mean these are kinda big. i'll go into pulse clinic and get it checked tomorrow"
Daria - the russian,2016-12-26 02:24:00,"I will talk now about how quickly I can fake or really fall for these girls. I will find someone that I could truly be with. This year in 2016, let us go through the list Vida Komer - this girl broke me. damn. fucked me all the way up. Made me question even being in the game. This was when I had only slept with 9 or 10 girls There was the girl from AcroYoga who was much older than me. I think I actually cried when she told me that she didn't want anything serious with me. There was the Cornell lawyer girl who I met in southern WV. Genius girl Then there was Carly Holthausen. Fantastic listener. She never did reject me although I never fully tried because I respect her and the fact that she has a boyfriend. Fantastic person to be around. I couldn't be with her on my last day in Greenville because I wanted to try my luck in Charlotte. I now maybe wish I would have spent that last evening with her. I will see her again. Lastly, there is Daria, the girl who works in logistics from Russia. She lives in St. Petersburg and has to travel to Belgium and Denmark sometimes for work. She knows all of the exchange rates off of the top of her head. She has a degree (I don't know what in though, a good guess would be logistics but I haven't heard of getting a degree in that). She is honest. She is real. I like the way that she grabbed my face to pull me close to tell me anything . She is a good kisser. Good ass. Solid B-cup probably. But I really wanted her. I really did. I wanted o spend the night with her. Have sex. Cuddle. Sleep with her. wake up with her. watch the sun drift into the room and lay on her face, prodding, poking, nudging her hazel eyes to reveal themselves to the world and to me. I want to see her in the morning and have her again once more before I will start my day. Maybe I will have a picture of her that I can keep with me where ever I go so I can remind myself of the beautiful person that I am able to be with. I would spend hours just kissing her. I would spend time just looking at her complete activities. She is not the most attractive girl that I have ever seen but all of these thing s together make her a 15 to me. She has perspective. She had the ability to hear arguments and determine what she thinks of things independently. I think I am here also because I really wanted to have sex with her and spend those extra special moments with her. She played me perfectly. She had me with her unavailability and since people want that which they cannot have and that which is scarce, I then wanted her. The basest of all our desires. I don't think she understands the power of the things she does. I doubt most girls do. I continually try to build myself up to shut up that effect on me but in truth, I like it, I like that feeling of total loss then safety. Or maybe I don't like it. I don't know. Game. The more I understand the more women I have access to and the better my life has become. I still don't have sex quite as much as I like but maybe that is how it is. I don't work hard enough or make up enough attempts in order to have the amount of sex with different girls that I desire. Damn it I really want to chill out for some months with one girl and figure out this relationship thing. That is why having these deep fleeting encounters with great girls hurts me. I want them I want to stay with them. But the weakness inherent in moving across the world for one girl would cause that relationship to die. That is the nice bullshit that the child me wants to put out there. I just want to please them and by doing that, please myself. That is the nice guy bullshit that hes kept me a creep monster for years. I haven't fully become Casanova because I still have this little guy who genuinely connects with some women and thinks that love is real and that deep connection is real and that there is a way to create a stable forever relationship without complications. Whatever. now I am just going to listen to my acoustic music in the play list,""when you look into her eyes"" and just think. and fall asleep . and love and dream. Dream of a relationship with a great girl. You'll find one Chi. You will be a hoe until then. In Estonia, I have approached 1 girl in the street with a number close but no date and probably 5-7 club/bar opens with one number close and meet up next day. Bye Chi. I hope you find what you are looking for."
as much as i enjoy...,2023-08-21 19:55:00,"bruv... as much as I enjoy content, I literally have to go on a reindoctrination compaign. My brain is so far in the opposite direction. I need to retrain my instincts towards women so that I can be more open to social interactions and the world outside of my no-risk contexts.you need to risk more. I need to risk more.that feeling in my chest when I'm going out on a limb and that limb might break tf off... bruv that's living. Of course, in many other areas of life, I want to risk less... with money for example. but lord. I gotta live. I have 6k in my savings right now. thats sweet."
big boy life,2018-07-11 17:53:00,"I'm still living out of my car. I am still gaming in my free time. I am still striving to become better. The one thing that I really resonated with RSD Tyler in his talk on identity where the biggest compliment that someone could give him was how much he has changed in a given period of time. That really resonated with me. I had a similar experience with some of the hyper liberal girls that I used to be friends with back in the day. They were flabbergasted at how much my views had changed in he past 3 years since they had last hung out with me. On the other hand, the guys that I have had in my life have said the exact opposite. They have said and complimented me on how much i am still the same as I was in high school. I didn't take it as a slight in the moment but now i am really thinking. The person who I portrayed in high school is the person I actually am to some extent now. I will say that now there is still some portrayal happening. I am still uncomfortable in many social situations and I choose not to express that outwardly. Instead I show the side that I want people to know. No one knows that sometimes I have crippling anxiety or apathy. No one knows my feelings or sorrows with the females. I keep it all bottled up inside. That is why I really am thankful to have friends like Gabs who will just listen to me for a little bit. It feels good to speak to someone without having an agenda on the table. Just good old fashioned conversation. That is what i try to emulate in my conversations with females out in life, the exception being that in all of those cases, I still have an agenda... to fuck. Maybe it is a noble goal to improve myself enough to a point where that isn't always the agenda when meeting a beautiful girl but we are not there yet. I still am not fully comfortable around a 10. I don't know how to behave. I don't know whether to be hyper push/pull, or generally good like I normally am, or cold, or what. I think that practice over the next few weeks will help with this. There is also that I have been having trouble being social. I don't know whether to respect my mind and conform to when I am feeling unsocial and just go off some where and play guitar or just force myself to fight through whatever is happening depending on the context of the situation. I think the compromise is that if I am already out, I might as well take advantage of the atmosphere and context that I am in to have fun and grow as a person. This would be extremely hard, especially on the days when I am feeling tired/out of it. On the other hand, having days when I am alone and get to be with myself and my thoughts, guitar, voice, and being is good for my emotional health. In the upcoming weeks, I hope I will balance these two things out. I have a weekly regimen of lifting, dancing, russian, guitar, singing, work, and potentially extra work via uber or stripping (lol). I don't know if it will work all together or for how long but we will fugging try. I'll talk to you later my friend. Quick memory. I went to myrtle beach last week and met a nice 27 year old nurse in a bar. She was wearing an all black outfit so i asked her if she liked her men like she liked the outfits that she wore. She was on a trip with 7 other nurses that worked in New Jersey. i danced wit her all night and met up with her in the afternoon of the next day. I brought my speedo and guitar to the beach and serenaded the girls with a rendition of Perfect and Your Man. The water was perfect and warm and beautiful. I really enjoyed spending that time with this random girl. We kissed sporadically thought out the day and got so spend some time alone on the beech before I walked her back to her place. i met up with her and her friend during fireworks. I should have waited until after because there was a time stamp on my arrival and after i drove them back my time had run out. They would not let me hang out with the girl that I was funning around with after that moment. So i went home alone, grabbed my guitar, and practiced songs on the beach till 4/5am. I got pretty decent and Boyfriend by Justin Bieber. After Myrtle i went to Cincinnati to hang out with my friend Kobe. We went out on a boat with some of his guy friends. That was a lot of fun. Then we went out at night. I talked to a lot of people. This was a generally good night because I started being social immediately upon leaving the house. Talked to a couple on the corner that was busy taking photos of architecture. Talked to some people in the brewery that was right beside kobes place (3 points brewery). We then went to the outside place that used to be neons. That is where I really hit my stride. I pulled Kobe's friend Kade into a set of a nurse (maybe) and an architect. I made a verbal mistake of claiming that one girl had an amazing personality while the other one was just hot. She was obviously offended. Next, I started running the bar with my moves. I had a mini crowd that was watching my antics. I noticed a group of three girls standing directly behind me. I kept acting then took the first opportunity to warm approach them., It went well and I ended up isolating the one. I should have tried to kiss her or escalate while I had her in my crosshairs. Anyway, her friends ended up dragging her away. I thought that she was going to come back but she was gone from the bar when I walked around. I ended up going back downtown and going to Jefferson Social. She was there with another guy. That hurt. That really fucked with me a bit. I've never thought a thing was going so well to have someone else chosen over me. I was able to rebound and kiss an FMP from GE but she ended up leaving me for her friends later and not texting back. It went well but I did n't h have a plan to lead her anywhere and there was too much idling on the dance floor. Have a plan for action in advance so that you can make the next move when the time comes. I need to practice seeding the pull. good job last week. A good high level view is needed from night to night from time to time. I think I will start doing more of these if not to just practice my typing but to also see if patterns and sticking points start to emerge from my sets."
"Hello, Hi. I tried for the first time in awhile",2017-02-04 22:12:00,"It went well. I walked out of the night with four phone numbers, no kisses. I'd say I approached 9-16 girls last night depending on how you demarcate approaching, i.e. how you cont members of each group. At best, I was right under a 50% conversion to phone number rate, with one text back which stopped responding a few minutes ago. So 10% approach to text response rate and 0% date conversion. I tried moderately hard. I was going pretty well as far as talking to the girls that I wanted to talk to and keeping conversations going. As far as sticking points go, I did notice that the conversations had no goal. I was trying to get to know girls instead of creating emotional spikes in other more fun methods of conversation. I always forget that shit though. I think part of all this is trying. I am trying hard to impress. I am trying to make something happen. As soon as I am able to establish my intent free of the outcome, that is make my intentions known with leading towards that goal without trying, I'll be fine. It is a semi-paradox but it's definitely navigable with the right intent. I did get hit with a couple shit tests that I don't think I played very well. The first was some cunt guy reached into my conversation and claimed that the girl I was talking to was his girl friend. I asked him for permission to keep talking to her. That was pussy shit. In this moment, I still don't know what the proper response would have been. Looking back, if I had been in a less caring mood, the self amused response would be a smirk accompanied by, ""Interesting choice, I guess you can have her back if you want? I don't know what your purpose is here. blah blah"" That does also come off try-hard at the end. IDK but whatever. The second shit test was the girl I talked to hit me with,""Oh so you're calling me unpure"" when I remarked that I was a pureboy because I had no tattoos or piercings. I launched into a story explaining the discrepancy but that was clearly the beta pussy way of dealing with that. I could have said. Yes. You are bad. You are a bad bitch and I'm bored of hanging out with my normal nerdy boring pure folk. What's the coolest adventure you've done in the last 6 months?"" That would have been a nice way to steer into the hydroplane then course correct with the question. Anyway, we doing a round two tonight. I will try again. Maybe I need to hit that higher volume if I want to get into my idgaf god mode, free of outcome but full of intent. I'll try. bye dad"
who am i,2014-12-01 17:11:00,"Ever since i swallowed the proverbial red pill of society and had my eyes opened with regards tho things like feminism and the state, I really just feel helpless. I know that's probable not the 'correct' way I should be feeling and I'm setting up my self to forever be a victim of the system, but I don't know any other way to see it. When a woman gets me fired over her dislike of me or a girl lowkey starts spreading rumors that I tried to sexually assault her, I just feel helpless. I can't do anything to fight it. If I try, I am either laughed off this planet. People just don't care about what is true. If I have learned anything from the beginning of this year till now, it is that people do not care about the truth. The only want what feels nice. They only want what fulfills their biological role and any further analysis is 'you just like to argue' or I'm just annoying. Fuck all you assholes. What would you have me do? I'm really struggling. It's a much different struggle than that of the past though. Instead of complaining about not being able to gain a woman's atttention (which I still do sometimes but will stop soon (rap music and creating it has significantly contribute to that state of mind and reading over past creations has opened my mind to this)), I complain about being around them in particular. Well I have to go start lifting for the first time in a year. Wish me luck! Chibuzor Ejimofor Lost Boy in a Woman's World"

Feelings,2019-09-19 05:59:00,"I’m fighting a lot of things right now. I’m fighting the simultaneous disappointment and thirst associated with women. I saw too many girls today that were sexy and even texting some on Hinge arouses my thirst so high that I feel the immediate need to go downtown and satisfy the urge with massive action. I truly really want to be inside of a woman even through I also know that conquering another body will not doing anything positive to my psyche or subconscious. If anything, it will only reinforce whatever unhealthy sick drive that continues to force you to want to do these things with out concern for your own mental of physical health. There is no plan with these girls, There is only momentary communication followed by sex. I know there can be more and I know that these relationships can be deeper... I just need to figure that out for myself and dashing off whilst in the midst of trying to do a dancing workout isn’t the move. I’m also fighting the urge to lay back and do nothing. There is nothing that some part of me would like better than to just lay back and veg out to some sadistic porn followed by eating candy while watching a favorite episode of The Office followed by a bedtime where I dream about the aforementioned women loving me as I am. I am also fighting the need to choose between Russia and China. I want more time. I know I desperately want to go to Russia. I am just not in the best financial space and going to Russia might put me there indefinitely. China is a nice compromise between money, experience teaching, and adventure but for some reason, I am just crazy hesitant to answer the call and sign the contract. You know, I know that once I find my purpose in life, the correct decision will become clear. But until that time, I don’t fucking know. My heart is telling me to go to Russia. At 25, my dad got up and left the country he was in for more opportunities. At 27, Philochko left his life in NYC for Russia where he’s thrived for the past 6 years. He is the king over there... that said, he is a business man and a grinder. He puts his mind on shit and doesn’t stop till he gets what he put his mind on. I have been that way in the past and I’m ready for this again. I am just afraid of failure. I’m afraid of failing so hard that I get stuck and can’t find a way out. The pros and cons are there for both countries. I need more clarity. I will reach out to the guy I’ve been chatting with for awhile and ask how he did it. He said that he struggled for awhile if I remember but he’s thriving now. These things are causing what feels like a pit of despair to open up in my body. Though I know that I am confident with women and I have accomplished a lot... though I know that I have two open offers to leave the country and possible two offers to stay (Dupont/Milliken/and possibly Eaten)... though I know that I have a job as a bouncer at a bar where I get paid $50 a night to hit on girls and a job in the daytime delivering food that is sometimes lucrative... though I know that I will be able to fix my vehicle with just a little bit of elbow grease in the morning for 0$ which will leave me with brand new no noise breaks... though I know that I haven’t communicated with my father on my business ideas though I talked with him for a long time last week... all of these things come together and weigh on my soul. I feel like I take action on a regular basis but all the time this pit of despair comes back and haunts me. I can solve a lot of these tomorrow... fix my car in the morning, send the signed china contract, send a message to the Russia lady and ask to start work in the summer term, send dad my website name along with a list of some of the rompers that I would buy in bulk and put up adverts for, put time on my calendar to talk to women, put time on my calendar to meet with the friends I have in town, put time on my calendar to meet with friends that are out of town one last time and save up to meet with them............... The girl thing still can destroy me. the idea that I know how to speak to a new girl and maybe get her to like me weighs on me all day long and every girl I let pass me by in the day or night, builds up to crush my self image and soul. Why, I don’t know. It is some fucked combination of FOMO, the need for physical touch as a love language that is strangely and completely absent from my life, and the want to satisfy the self image of the pimp since if I go too long without sex according to some part of me, I’m basically a virgin again."
These new girls - the old chi,2017-10-09 03:15:00,"The part of me that I have been struggling with for a long time is the fear of appearing vulnerable. Virtually all of my game is geared toward banishing any semblance of weakness that someone could exploit. For the most part, I would say that it has worked. I witnessed some disrespectful shit at my job at HQ this weekend that illustrated a scene that I know in 2017 would never happen to me but in 2008-2015 was a relatively common occurrence. Namely, there was an after party scheduled after work. Several of the bartenders were deliberating whether they should go or not, One of the more beta bouncers spoke up and said to one of the girls, ""You should go because I want you to go!"". Lord, as soon as those words exited his mouth, I know that he had made a mistake. The bartender that was the target of his statement replied quickly, without ANY hesitation,""Oh, well, your opinion doesn't matter to me so bye."" and then just continued her conversation like nothing happened. That kind of nonchalant disrespect and rejection was something that I feared for a long time and, as a defense, I created a version of myself that that type of shit does not happen to. I am similar to Peter, except in the fact that I created the version of me that I wanted TOWARDS the goal of being better and accomplishing my goals with women while he settled with removing the risk. I have removed most of the risk of that explicit, soul-crushing rejections like this man experienced on Saturday through conscious effort. I can't physically imagine a girl treating me like that anymore. Now onto the purpose of this article. I am onto the new girls. The freshmen. The girls who've grown up in the increasingly liberal, highly sexualized culture of the West and I am slowly relearning how these girls behave and how to craft my actions toward maximizing the opportunities to sleep with them. Be fun. Be more fun than everyone else. That is all. I have a new girl on the line named Cassidy. I met her 3-4 weeks ago randomly in the streets with my Indian friend Parth. As normal with the first few interactions of the day, she conversated with us notified us of her non-single status and got in a car with her boyfriend who pulled up a couple minutes after we showed up. She recognized me a couple weeks later at HQ where she applied to be a bartender and here we are, Sunday 10/9, and she is considering breaking up with her boyfriend and is on the verge of diving in on me. Lord, how the turntables. I really hope (hope is stupid, it's been awhile since I've had it and it only leads to disappointment and weak behavior) that I get to sleep with her. She is so cute and small. Her skin is perfect. I can't imagine what her pristine pussy looks and behaves like. I don't know how I will accomplish this as a man who is living in the woods but goddamn it, if I pull at any point this year, I am a god. Regardless, I'm a god, but with this on my record, I am objectively a god, not just a god for all intents and purposes. But again, like all girls, I can feel my spirit faltering. When I'm with her, I don't want to let her go. I want to explore her. I want to know everything about her. I want to know what happens when my tongue touches every square inch of her skin, how she will react to my passion-laden kissing of her neck, and how she will handle the 2.5-finger girth of my erect scepter. I want her to hold me after. I want her to hold me and kiss me on the forehead and tell me that I will get through this. I want her to tell me that everything is okay and that I am perfect the way I am. I want her to tell me that chemical engineering sucks but that if anyone can survive the shit it is me. I want her to tell me that I've been through worse and survived. I want her to tell me how much she likes me and what she wants to do and with me. This is the weakness. These are the thoughts that I stuff down until the moment, the sweet moment when I see that there is no longer a chance for the pussy bitch weak Chi to be destroyed. I suspect though, that this will be just like every other experience before it. The fuck means nothing, the buildup is all jokes, and the after is blah. I can't date her. I don't want to hold her back from the other shit that one her age can experience in college. I don't want to cage everything that she has been socialized for. Well, I do want to, I just don't think that it would work because of the way the world is. And there. that is the thought that would destine the relationship to fail. If I am not man enough to have no doubts and not weakness, she will find someone to dill that one doubt or that one weakness. She will find that one bug and jailbreak the whole phone. In the world of relationships, I'm not sure a software update can fix this. What's the difference between being vulnerable and needy?"
today was okay,2022-11-02 01:03:00,"i woke up and got a lot donereading has been nice. i really like this colleen hoover book ""it ends with us"". I like it a lot. It reminds me of my former life when I had intimacy with women and played the game. Fuck I miss love. I miss lust.I am sick. I think I'll get over it fast but still. the nose is stuffy and the head is pressureized.I'm not teachign my idioms class well. It is a ridiculous setup for a class. There doesn't seem to be many easy ways to practice that many phrases other than different recalls to memory. Interesting. But I don't want ot put in effort to create more stuff for the kids to partake and remember. fuck. i might have to put more effort into this job.hate asking people for shit. fuck i just had to ask my friend if his couch was free for a night. that's so fucking cringe man. idk i'll ever get used to that. there's just always the risk that there'll be a moment where it'll be too much and blah blah. never want to reaach those moments.my eyes are burning holes in my head.but the day has been relatively productive. I just want more of a direction from my brain for what i will be doing with this fabric"
I care too much -> therefore I will always fail,2017-02-13 20:31:00,"Here's a paradox. If I don't care, then I don't care and nothing happens. If I do care, then it's too much and nothing happens. There should be a place where there is some care but not too much but there isn't. I can't stop. It's really annoying. If I don't care about this girls then I will never think about her and if I never think about her then, I could give a fuck about whether she lives or dies. I already hate the majority of females on the planet. Deciding not to care about the few that are left would put me in a different place. Unfortunately, Chi, that is the way things have to be. Literally, there can be no vaginal thoughts in lurking anywhere in my mind while logic is front of me. I then want to logically seduce, which leads to logical fucking, which leads to emotional loss of attraction from the female, which leads to an emotional and logical loss for Chi. That is the trajectory that is entered 99% of the time I initiate contact with a female. The guy is right. I do think about shit too much. fuck all this tho. Leah is the reason for this essay. also, I say one of my old crushes, Olivia and she is the same. I saw the uncomfortably in her eyes the entire time we were speaking. I wasn't able to break through. I saw that she purposefully had a guy speaking to her so that I wouldn't try to talk to her again. This is a sad sad sad example of what happens when I start to really like a girl. I should really just anticipate the jump off of the high horse onto the cold hard cement every time because that really is what happens. There is no win to be had here. Do I want to get numbers? No, but I do because I have to. Do I want to talk to women? No, but I do so because it sometimes is fun and rarely leads to sex which is also fun at the moment. Do I want to have sex with girls? No, but I do because it feels better than yanking myself off. Do I want a relationship with a woman? No, but I need to experience something different. Do I like Chemical Engineering? No, but it is shortest time path to starting a career. Funny how my attitude toward the possibility of a relationship with this girl can change so drastically in such a short period. Don't ever let anyone tell you that read receipts don't have power. They may be the most powerful things on this earth."
"humility, the ego, and excuses",2016-11-14 14:23:00,"No one ever ever ever wants to hear your pathetic pussy excuses. If someone is asking for en explanation as to why you didn't do something that you should have and there really is no reason why you didn't, express that, apologize, and express that now that you know the expectation, this mistake won't happen again. The fact that this isn't a common exercise for me indicates where I am at in my growth. The ego is still controlling my actions and the way that I do things. I know how I feel when grown ass men start making excuses for not getting what they want but there is a blockage in my brain for recognizing in the moment when I am doing the exact same bullshit. A good policy for the future is that if I ever automatically start crafting a response, that is probably my ego protection that evolved from my childhood reaching it's dirty little claws up from its pseudo-grave to regain its control over my consciousness. Any time when I am afraid of the reprimand or feel ill-equipped to handle a question or situation, notice that feeling that wells up. This is the same feeling that comes when you are walking down the street and see a girl that you should approach. This is the same feeling that comes when you are with a girl you are supposed to be friends with but have feelings for. This is the same feeling that appears when you have a large project that has no end in sight juxtaposed with the required end date. Recognize that feeling, own it, and deal with it appropriately with the life lessons that you have learned. Either be honest, apologize and express that you are working on getting whatever this is back on track, take massive action to correct your lack of forethought in the moment, or apologize and add a bit of fog to cover your steps if dealing. But really never do the last thing. Only in dire circumstances that don't exist should you fog. I should go back and delete that sentence but I won't because it recognizes my ego's need to have a loophole out of personal responsibility that is required to be a boss in these situations. Stop making excuses. Stop needing reasons to live. No more of this becoming a person bullshit. You are a grown ass man and you need to start acting like one if you want the respect of your peers, superiors, and coworkers. The name of the blog will be changing. I'm the man. I am an ever-growing, ever-changing, critically thinking man."
didn't get teh job,2023-06-30 03:55:00,i feel a complete lack of motivation to do things. it just feels tough to have had a relatively easy path out of my bullshit to have it taken away. i am okay with a tough path i think. i mean it's bullshit but it is what it is. to have this easy thing and to not have it in the end sucks. it's hard man. I haven't really done anything in a couple days. I haven't been about to even focus on my shit even with adderall. i am extremely unserious. i feel weak . i feel worthless. i just want to lay on concrete and be dead for awhile. just be nothing. man how do people bounce back from this bullshit. really the only thing is to just keep dong shit. fuck
the hardest part,2017-04-14 08:49:00,"The hardest part about all of this is that here is no redo. Even if I think of the perfect line or realise my misstep an hour later, there is no redo. It's done. That past has become the past and there is only solemnity, regret, and disappointment. Do better the brain says. You'll remember next time and succeed at the next opportunity the prefrontal cortex continues. But this is a circle. I can't break my cycle. I can't break through what is currently making me into who I am. I want to break down and become a different human but I am so attached to the mannerisms that have been Morgantown Chi that I am stuck. How to be another person. I think that I will look up a character profile and a backstory and act hard the next time that I am out. I have got to break this attachment to mannerisms habits and ego. Those things will be my downfall and my death. Live my nigga live. Just like the tests you failed, just like the job interview you misspoke in, just like the speech you stuttered through, it exists and there is no change. Accept the past for what it is and move on. Obviously, easier said than done. Chi Fuck you. Good luck with Olivia but Fuck You for Texting her. I hate you for It. Good Luck Though. Fuck You."
fuck this shit - shit shit = life,2019-05-15 19:13:00,"I feel awful. I just don't feel good.

Movie stuff,2017-05-19 17:51:00,"Favorite Movies The Dark Knight Nightcrawler The Planet of the Apes (1968) - Charleton Heston Rise of the Planet of the Apes Dawn of the Planet of the Apes High School Musical 1-3 About Time My Fair Lady - for the wit and language styles of the leads The Daughter (Netflix) - the twists come and hit you out of nowhere. This movie pretended to be predictable and the characters' fate ends up way worse than you expect. Michael Flatley is the lord of the dance. Romantic Comedies I've Seen + Synopsis + Review Charlie St Cloud - Zac Ephron - A weird movie about ghosts and shit. Zac Ephron is upset that his (?Little brother?) dies. The guy appears to him all the time to hang out. Then, he starts experiencing hanging out with some girl that is lost. Then he goes out and finds her and already knows everything about her. I'm not pro it. - the whole thing where you destroy shit because you are mad doesn't make sense to me and therefore it pisses me off when I see it in movies. It is irrational and bullshit and you will just end up having to clean your mess later... - Also, God isn't real. - Zac Ephron sails and then doesn't sail because of his brother and then sails again because of the girl. Love and Honor - Liam Hemsworth Pretty sure this movie was some bullshit about a man being in the army. He came back home on a break and found his girl being a whore and tried to get her back and finally did. He also went A wall. Drinking Buddies - Olivia Wilde, Anna Kendrick A Perfect Man (unfinished) I got triggered 20 minutes in by the girl going back to the man who cheated on her with her best friend. I literally had to take a break and rationalize why it made sense for her to do that and why the fuckboy shit works in the first place. Begin Again The Switch Seeking a friend fo the end of the world - Steve Carell Ethan Hawke Love trilogy Before Sunrise - A man daygames a French girl on the train and spends the whole day in Vienna with her. They plan on meeting 6 months later. This is a romantic movie with a hopeful, albeit nieve view of love and romance. Before Sunset - The man actually showed up and the girl wasn't there. He writes a book 9 years later and runs into her on his book tour. He is married to someone he doesn't love and has a kid. He spends the day with his love and the movie ends with him knowingly missing his flight and possibly choosing true love over his home life in America. - This movie looks at love and romance positively, believing that even through mistakes, true love and romance still exist and one should do strive to achieve it. Before Midnight - The man ends up staying with his love and having twin girls. They are not married and they live in Europe. His ex-wife has custody of his only son and he is hurting because he can't be a bigger part of the kid's life. - This movie shows the negative of staying with a person forever. It shows the way that arguments can get out of control and hurtful very quickly. This movie is the reason I am afraid of eternal commitment and marriage. Remember Me - Robert Pattinson (active noting) - Single Ladies Utility Tote is a fantastic idea - Wrong. They have the wrong idea of love.

Girl Report - Hinge and the night out 8/21 Saturday,2019-09-23 06:21:00,"Man I have a lot of options. I am also broke. I can honeslbyly say that I wish that I was stuck in my bullshit job doing jack shit than here broke just waiting for the next move. This shit sucks. Being at the whim of the word. I try to keep as much control as possible but this is hard. This life situation has forced me to live on the bright side more than ever. I gave in to the darkness within for a few weeks there and went a really really bad place. I don’t know, I just thought it would feel good to be ‘realistic’ or own up to my issues. While I think it is good to look at life as reasonably as possible and to not add any sort of veneer to what is going on, I also think that you get to choose your truth and how to orient yourself on a daily basis. Whatever I speak into existence is real and the more often that I let negativity and the feeling surrounding these circumstances affect me or stick around, the worse off that I will be. Any way, on to the life report. The night out started similar to other nights out. Slow. I was bouncing at the Bank again. There were some sets when I entered but not many. I started by talking to a girl that I have initiated things with the past night owork. I tried to make her chase through several teasers about her dance moves and disqualifies around those dance moves as well as the size of her butt etc. These were working like a charm and she was hanging off mom my arm for that portion of the night. This was about 30 or so minutes. Then she started doing drugs and associating with drug dealers and I fell off her radar over the night. Oh well, moving on. The best part of the night was these group of three girls. They looked so nice and innocent and I could tell that they did not go to places like this often. At that moment, I was speaking to my old and literally old friend Eric the old pimp of morgantown and I was telling him that I was going to have to leave him to pull up on these girls since they looked os innocent but also as a result about to leave. He nodded and I did a round then dove in. I rolled in there with that innocent observation and the girls reacted loudly in my favor. Basically everything I said or did thereafter got a huge reaction from them It was like being a comedian and every joke you hit just kills. I moved from that to get information from them Two of the girls in the group were cute and the third was a big fat black girl whom I mostly ignored, perhaps to my detriment. We’ll never know. I asked question like what music did they actually listen to, where were they from, and how much alcohol did they have to drink. They responded positively like I said and I moved to say,”don’t leave without getting my insta because you all are so fun and I want to hang out with you.” They agreed and I went on another round. No clue why I didn’t just close them there and then. As a bouncer there’s not a hing chance that the Gil is actually going to stick around that specific club all night. Most girls do a lot of club hopping so if you end up talking to someone the best policy is to get their information and start contact with them immediately so that you know who they are the entire night. Maybe you can meet up with them later but if you don’t get their contact in the moment, you will likely lose them. And that is what happened here. I turned my back and the girls had disappeared. Boo that sucks. Next there was a tall brunette girl that really liked m y day e moves and kept trying to dance with me. I saw how hot her friends were and I saw the dynamic of their interaction so when this girl approached me, I led with a lot of push pull. On her initial approach I danced with her a bit, told her I loved her and asked for her name. I let her go. On her second approach, Teach Me How to Dougie was playing and she was trying to Dougie. I was terrible. So I approached her and gave her shit for her terrible Dougie. This caused her to try harder and for her friends to laugh a bit. I tried to teach her demonstrating that I was in fact a good dancer. She could not learn at all. I grabbed her and brought her in close and told her to stick to her strengths. She had a decent butt and was very fun so she should stick to Cardi B and Beyonce songs. She laughed and agreed and I said that I would be testing her later on that music. I left her again. She approached a third time and grabbed my arm and started dancing on me. I laughed and literally pushed her off of me. I think that was the last interaction we had before she left the bar with out my knowledge. Unfortunate. Too much push without any closing or vibing. Bad game. Do better next time. Next, there were two girls that were sitting at a table and were clearly interested in speaking to me. They had been staring for most of the night. But for some goddamn reason I just played with their attention, getting close but talking to one of my guy friends that was standing nearby, looking in their direction and almost making eye contact before turning away. I don’t know why I was on this type of shit. It didn’t work obv and they ended up losing interest and fraternizing with other guys and people for the rest of the night. This was dumb since they stayed the longest and I probably could have been interacting with them a lot longer and through out the night if I would have made that approach when I should have... at the beginning of the night. The last thing of note was the the owner of the bar got in an argument with a girl and her mom and asked me to remove them immediately. I had to manhandle the girl to get her out of the bar. It wasn’t pretty. I should look up better techniques on how to remove people from the bar because that was ridiculous. There were many sets throughout the night that I didn’t approach. I could about 5 or 6 very attractive sets that I could have had good interactions with. I was stopped by fear in 2 cases... the very hot blonde that reminded me of Hannah g in that the was too pretty to really do anything or dance on the dance floor. A very boring girl but very cute. And then there were two bombshells that walked in... one with lipstick and a skirt and idk about the other. And the rest, I was stopped by may own blaze apathy towards women. I don’t really know what this mood is but it is just a lack of caring whether or not I interact positively or negatively with any group of girls. This version doesn’t want to stir the pot or step out of line to be potentially rebuked by the women or the bosses. I think part of this came out when Omar (one of the bar owners) yelled at me for dancing when there were allegedly people smoking in the bar. That shit kinda broke me. I have been trying to get to a solid place where I feel comfortable vining but I honestly have a bit of fear around that happening again. And then there are the hinge girls... but that shall be a story for another day. Good night."
order is a weakness,2017-09-13 19:30:00,"I need to have everything in my life in a specific way to I get anxious and refuse to move on. I missed a flight that was paid for by Epic today. I just had to have my new iPhone set up in that exact moment. There was not setting it up on the plane or when I got to the hotel. I had to get it done in the moment. And now I am missing out on another experience. This hurts. I set everything up. I planned out my whole trip and life. And poof. It all falls away. Every time I try to plan out my life sequentially, the building crumbles and I am left standing with my pants down and dick out in the place where the bathroom used to be. Oh well is my thought. This is the way of the world. If life was easy, it wouldn't be fun. I already have a job."
vascillation,2017-08-26 15:53:00,"I'm here again. Where is that exactly? To game or not to game. Let's display that ground that we are on so that we can move forward with the discussion. I see girls. I like the way some of them look. They have pretty faces, boobs, and nice butts. They have eyes that can catch your attention from 20 feet away. In a past year, I would have said something. Now, I will not. I don't want to. I no longer feel the need to work for this shit. I don't want it bad. I don't want it at all to some extent. I started my job at HQ (previously Lux and before that, Karma, the first club I ever entered with Jimmy Nutts) a couple days ago. It is a place that allows 18+ clientele. God. I don't know what is wrong with me. I am simultaneously repulsed and attracted to these half naked 18-year-olds gyrating to trash music. I attracted for obvious reasons. The repulsion is newer. I think is coming from my newer want for something more real than the fuckboy lifestyle I've been on. Seeing these otherwise pretty girls give it up for trash guys to trash music saddens me and reveals the true futility of trying to find a serious girl in this atmosphere. Asexuality is the way to go. I am going to talk to Seth more about his lifestyle today because I'm genuinely interested in adopting it during my professional career and onward. This girl thing can only hurt me. The pleasure? A few minutes of good pussy. Good pussy. That is also the thing that I am repulsed by. I hate that I like these girls just because of their bodies. They have absolutely NOTHING to give me other than pussy and yet here I am again and again, fretting about whether one of them is going to respond to my message or meet me out for adate. They aren't worth the shoes that their dad's bought them and still, I'm feeling this way. For once, I'd like the opportunity to like a girl for her merit. Obviously, not solely on merit, but you under stand my point. Lastly, I see a danger. I see the powderkeg that every college campus is sitting on, and WVU is no different. We have a far left and a gender studies department same as everyone else. We have a significant black population just like everyone else. Every one of these girls needs to get blackout drunk to fuck a guy in these clubs. And they do. And they literally stumble home in the arms of some guy. This college exists in the gray area of rape every night and everyone knows it and still plays. The short term pleasure of pussy outweighs the potential life-ending consequences. Aside #1: the reason more people don't go to HQ is because it is branded as a black club. Ask everyone in town who the clientele of the place is and they will say niggas. And anyplace that has more than say ~4 niggas at a time, and I do mean nigga not black, does not succeed. There is an implicit threat of violence that could erupt at any moment since niggas are sensitive. Whatever man. I'm tired of vacillating between the extremes of doing zero game and diving all the way in. Fuck this."
becoming a person. I don't like these people too,2016-09-16 14:43:00,"I don't like people. And I say this in reference to: feminists (of any kind) - I dislike you because the activism of feminism is ""fuck men"" and you using this label for any reason supports that regardless of your justification. #blacklivesmatter - Lets be real. Unless you actually know the person who was killed or maimed or affected, you don't really give a fuck about that person's life (unless its a child or a woman). Black lives don't matter to anyone. White lives don't matter to anyone. But especially black lives don't matter to black people. police violence is negligible. also most of it is justified. I am very pro the murder of degenerate blacks. same with degenerates of all races. but honestly especially for blacks. child men (white knights) - grown men who can't go get what they want. grown men who don't have friends and don't have the capability to talk to a random person and enter a conversation to get a different perspective without getting offended. anti-gun mutherfuckers - none of these motherfuckers actually know anything about guns. these guys just look a gun and say, ""oh that shit looks scary. make it illegal."" Shit is more complicated than just making shit illegal. most women - most women can't think for themselves, are overcome by their biology and their emotions. i love generalizing. I like women who are like men. But I am not gay. So fuck you and don't try to convince me to go towards your degeneracy caused by your childhood sexual trauma (that is a message to gays who want me to be gay) I am confident that I can identify traits of these types of people listed above in the first 30 minutes of interaction with people. Everyone should have the ability to jude quality of character and read body language. Which brings me to my last group: I dislike people who make faces at my judgments of character and my accurate readings of situations. Still becoming a person but I am more a person than any of these other kids. Even these grown folk don't have original thoughts. Not that my thoughts are all original but they can't critically think about information they just default to what their tribe decides is correct. BUT I am still becoming a person."
what's the expectation,2024-12-30 11:11:00,"guess what i'm talking about hahaclaudiahasn't responded and i know she's landed becaused i checkd the flight. she landed at like 1am maybe and it's 6pm dec 30. now, i know how this looks. why the fuck do i know when her plane landed. well i looked it up. i needed to know if she was making another decision to ignore my message. now ot be reasonable and fair, what's the expectation? honestly, the way that these women are experiencing me, ti seems like i'm basically a chatbot... like anytime you send a message, BOOM, i'm there and i'm making jokes and answering. i'm freely available. always. now the game would be to play like i'm not available. don't really want ot play so much. BUt i can't be freely available. i truly shouldnt' be responding as quickly and as frequently.in my head though, i charish these small moments. i feel like my life is filled with lack and in this small period of time, someone cares about me. dramatic i konw. now why don't i give a fuck when anyone else messages me? dunno. probably because now, she's pushed me into a scaricy mindset.. well lets say, i've pushed myself into this mindset.i like the pain. i really do. oh god feeling things is horrible but at least you feel.at least you feel. still, i'll have to set boundaries on my time if i want to keep that girl. it's probably skating on fuckin zero if not already dead but hey, until the fucking fat lady sings man. i can't believe i'm this guy. chasing. wanting. desiring. how drole (don't konw what that word means)but hey, with all this, i might be back. making decent enough progress on the app. lets see"
microexpressions: this bitch,2014-12-02 00:47:00,"Admittedly, today I look awful. I'm dressed as a slob. I full well admit I do not look my best. I call myself out on it because sometimes I get self conscious about what others are thinking. Getting that out in the open makes me feel comfortable that they are not talking behind my back about it. but his bitch today. I was on my way to class but I stuck close to Nathan because I saw some cute girls walking toward him and I wanted to interact with them, or at the very least get a closer look. the girl that I knew in the group, casually picks my jacket and says in a non-sarcastic tone, ""Nice Jacket."" Clearly it was not a nice jacket. It is the ugliest one I own. but because of the whether and because I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck what people think. Or at least that is my ultimate goal as a human. I don't think I will ever be able to completely remove that need from my psyche but I can at least significantly decrease it. Anyway, I call my self out as always. then this whore continues to complement Nathan on everything he is wearing and then pauses as she is turning to me. I call myself out again, laughing in nervousness. Then, I see it. Telltale disgust all over her face. I don't know if I would have noticed if not for my fleeting education on micro expressions but there it was. Plain as day. As I walked away I couldn't help but think why the disgust and what gives her the right? This whore opens up her legs to untold amounts of guys in and out of every weekend. This whore is in some bullshit major, probably communications. This whore will ultimately end up in some ditch (I mean this figuratively of course) in her life. Haha I can just see it now. I can just see all these girls like this that think they are higher than me now, crawling back in 5, 10, or 20 years. Ugly looking roast beef vaginas trying their little bullshit tricks in order to get me to become the provider of however many children are produced by said roast beef. I can't wait to laugh in their faces as I block them on my phone or laugh in their faces in the aisle the local Kroger or Walmart and then walk away to my better life filled with purpose, wisdom, money, happiness, and a constant pursuit of knowledge. I hope they choose me as their rejector. But if not this experience has helped reveal several parts about being me that were hidden. I like to say that I don't care what people think but it still sometimes irks me when I see people visibly judging me negatively. Now, at least, I have some vision for my future, however vague.

Chelsea,2015-01-26 03:42:00,"For the longest time, I wondered why the only girl I took on a date in 2014 stopped responding to my texts. I did everything right. My spontaneous approach to her on the street was fun for both and I believe that is what attracted her to me. I was 100% not the most attractive man that she was speaking to but she still chose me for some reason, albeit for only about a week. Did I really like her? I would say no but at the same time, I was so focused on sex and her ass and so on that my judgment and actions were skewed. I didn't take the time to enjoy her for her and instead I enjoyed the fact that I had finally gotten a girl that I perceived to be out of my league and focused on 'closing the deal' so I could be proud of at least 1 thing on my sexual record. After the second date, when I took her home and we were making out on the bed, I kept going for the button on her pants. I kept going and kept going regardless of the fact that I had gotten denied several times. She was the best kisser that I have ever experienced but instead of enjoying this, I just kept going for the inside of her pants. I had not earned the inside of her pants. This was a very strong girl, at least in my experience. For lesser girls, this would probably have worked and has in the past. The terrible effect that my interactions with women and people has created in me is not respecting some of these girls enough to take a second and appreciate who they are as people and what they can offer me in ways other than their vaginas. I spent way more social capital than I had and that is the reason she dropped me. I was good and I treated her correctly but, in the end, she could see that all I wanted from her was the inside of her panties. And that's bullshit. Not her bullshit. My bullshit. It's bullshit that I wasted her time and my time by not living in the moment and enjoying the experience of interacting with a beautiful and strong woman. My eyes were opened while watching a RSD video on Intent. Now, I'm looking at all of the relationships that I currently have with women. THEY ARE ALL RUINED. All I do is grab their asses and sexualize shit whenever possible. Whatever social capital I have built up by having awesome parties and being cool, I have spent and over drafted the fuck out of all these relationships. Although I hate the word 'creepy', I can now see and interpret what the word may mean in order to improve myself and my future relationships. For me, if someone calls me creepy, it simply means that they do not like me. The word is more annoying than hurtful at this point, since I automatically discount any criticism anyone has against me if they can not even slightly expound or support their criticisms. There will always be girls in the world that will meet me and call me that word. I've made my peace with that. Now, I've decided that although unfounded names are unfounded, the name caller may just be very ignorant on argument, have no interest in philosophy or the search for truth. There still might be some infinitesimal legitimacy to any given claim. If I come across any evidence myself that may support their theories, then clearly I have some work to do. In this situation, this insight has given me an even better definition for the word. Being 'creepy' could be another way of saying that I have overspent my social capital with a given female or group of females. In the future, I will try to enjoy the girls and people that I am choosing to possibly be in my life. I want thoughts, virtues, or intelligences that add to my life in some way. Most people have some quality that I may be able to enjoy. This realization is nice since I already know for the most part what qualities that I am 100% incompatible with. Okay Bye."
29 - Permenant Celibacy aka 23 dates,2017-06-28 22:53:00,"I am done. This is an aside. I will be writing a quick post on life. I refuse to have sex with girls anymore. I will be celibate for real this time. last night, I made an exception and went back to a girl's place after my work job in Burlington. She was not attractive. She was a 1st grade teacher. She was kinda fat. She texted me while I was working and said that I could come over after I finished at the job. So. I went back to the girl's place. She was a terrible kisser. Kissing me like a rabid dog. If you gave food to a starving African that would be how she was nibbling at my face. Disgusting. She sucked my dick. Terrible as well. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I don't care much for blowjobs. She was also bad at them since she only stayed around the head. Anyway. Now the evil part of the story. I started having sex with her and as normal, I was going to cum too soon. So I pulled out had turned her over. When I started to fuck her from behind I noticed something. Blood. Blood on my condom-enclosed dick. More and more blood. I thought it was a little bit at first. Then it was a lot. I don't think I've ever been more disgusted with anyone or thing in my life. I stopped and lightly exclaimed, ""Wait, are you on your period?"" I knew the answer. She responded, ""Oops, I should have told you Chi."" Well, damn. I asked where the bathroom was and carefully removed the blood soaked condom so that none of the blood touched my skin. I didn't make it. There were a couple spots that made it onto my skin. I dabbed the skin first with a napkin to remove most of the fluid then soaped my dick down. I was scared as fuck. That was the first time my rational mind was fully awake and present during a sexual activity. Fight or flight mode had been activated. I wasn't angry though. It was my fault. I chose to go home with her against my better judgement. I chose to break my vow of celibacy and my standard for sexual activity and kisses. And I suffered the consequences. In situations like this, I usually try to separate on a pseudo-positive not and talk the person's ear off while I carefully remove myself from the situation. I don't explode with anger unless my ego is cornered and disrespect is throwing the fight or flight flag way up and cutting off all of the exits. I removed myself. I was mostly in shock after. It was as if this was a sign from the universe or a god or something. The second I go back on something that I decided to do for my own betterment, I was punished. My age. 23 dates. A girl has to make it on 23 dates with me before she can see my penis. She has to last to a second date to get a kiss. This is final. Sex is not important to me. It brings me no pleasure. I'm done here. What makes me feel good are my hobbies and my relationships. Sex is not important and it can wait. Masterbate once per week. Live life. That is all."
Family doesn’t mean a lot to me,2019-09-18 00:09:00,"I don’t have a lot of positive experiences about the people that I grew up with and the ones that are positive are associated with the people that came into our lives during those years... the pastor at the church who gave me my first paying jobs, the friends that gave me the opportunity to get out of the house, the gifts from relatives that allowed me to live through games and books, the coaches of the sports teams that I was on that functioned as father figures when the one that I had was acting up. I’ve never held much stock into the whole family thing for this reason... the men that I call my brothers are much more my brothers than my actual brothers. I’ve bled, cried, laughed, talked, and bullshitted about every subject under the sun with these random men while there are so many subjects that are just off limits with my family. Their worldview and way of doing things is so divorced from the way I live my daily life that it is unrelateable. I don’t value their opinion on anything I do though at times I will seek out their life experience as older adults on the planet. And I don’t know how much value I can get from continuing a relationship there. I love my friends and the others that stepped in to give me the life that I’ve always wanted. I shudder to think that in the years when I will be leaving the country, my parents could pass away. I may be gone for a very long time. I will cry because these are the people that gave me life but further than that I don’t know. I know people look back and regret not forming relationships with their parents when there was the opportunity to do so later in life. Maybe this will be me in the future. But for now, I gotta go my own way as I’ve always done since I’ve been able."
I'm back,2017-08-10 17:20:00,"Oh god, it's going to be hard. I think I'm going to try to begin my cold approaching once again. It made me great before and it will help me with my mentality. I will be going out with my Day 1 Dustin this weekend. ""pump people's states all day"" I'm a professional out here. I need to get back onto being a leader of the men and women that I am around. I took the lead yesterday and created a fun interaction. It didn't end with sex but it ended up being an extremely fun night with one of my boys. I approached a 2 set at a bar during karaoke night with the question, ""What song are you going to sing."" They immediately responded positively and the interaction began. They were attracted to my look from the get-go and told me as much. I suspected that because of the slight eye contact that I got from them early on in the night. I interacted with them solo for 10-15 minutes. The girls were thirsty. The cuter one, C***** (name started with a C but I don't remember it), was down. I threw down my swing dance moves and she was hooked. I was close to a kiss but I could see her friend out of the corner of my eye and I knew that the judgment was going to stifle that move. I held her really close and kept the sexual touching to a minimum. Even so, she did mention that we were moving quite quickly. She was 33 and I dipped out of the age discussion quickly thereafter. I wasn't able to escape it all together though and later on, I had to battle the Age-LMR. Dustin and J Smoov joined after a bit and Dustin took over the girl that I was talking to. We worked in tandem and since we have the same sense of humor, we had a good time. We ended up in a feminist discussion about how the girl was scared to walk home because rape and why this girl was a vegetarian. We ended up leaving and going to another bar where we talked to another old woman who wasn't nearly as attractive. There was a group of young hot girls sitting in the back but I didn't have the ballies to pull up so I didn't. Lately, I've been looking for good ins with women so I'm not entering purely off of her attractiveness. My default is entering with an opener based around a compliment to her. I don't like doing that because 100% of the time, the girl hasn't earned my approval yet. Second, I like the dynamic of her wondering if I actually like her or if I'm just being generally cool and happen to be having a conversation with her."
don't wanna try don't wanna try no more,2017-02-02 01:23:00,"I haven't been on here in a minute. It is the first day of february. Valentines day is coming up. I have two prospects. One is a nice lady who is in graduate shool at my university. I hit her up on facebook but she was too busy for coffee.... so.. raincheck i guess? Hold up. So I was talking to my sister today and she mentioned something interesting which prompted my to babble and babble. She said that I don't have to try that hard because when she shows my picture to her friends, they think that I'm attractive. I know that I am attractive. It is not looks that attracts girls though. It is vibe. Litness, swave, fun, attitude. That is the reasons why I'm not just slaying out here. Also, the bar is 100% higher for me than white folk. It seems to be higher for me than for Nathan, my black friend. So. The conclusion is that my game needs to be better. It doesn't seem to work at all or nearly as well now that I am back home. Now, I haven't gone on a girl by girl rage night of action only towards God mode. So maybe I have no right judging the WV women. I haven't tried. Really really tried to break through the wall that exists every night and every day. Do I want to try harder though. Not really"
hello struggle.,2017-09-20 21:25:00,"I have the queasy feeling again. The dissatisfaction and uncertainty of life is back. I don't know what my future will hold. There is something about knowing hat the next 2 years of your life will look like if you just made a different choice. Now I have nothing. I have no full-time lined up. I don't know what the fuck is going on in my classes. And I don't know how to navigate my social life. Uncertainty sucks. I want to do several things. I want to go out with peter and parth and teach them both how to live. I want to ....whatever. so I went on a date with Nadia the sorority girl in Chi O. Wonderful girl. Seems spontaneious, adventurous. All great qualities to have in a man. In a woman, these things scream out hoe, I shudder to think of the amount of dick this girl has taken part in. I have taken part in a ton of puss as well but for a girl, the pussy just isn't the same and the psychologoy just isn't the same. She is off the legitimate list. further, I really did forget tat she was a soroity girl for a bit. Until I went on a wald with her and ran into one of her'sisters'. Jesus christ is lord. This girl would not stop speaking. I hated it. I hated every second of it. During the interaciton I payed close attention to the girl I had gone on a date with. She feeds off of this shit. It is exciting hearing about what all of the other girls ar getting into and what guys the others girls fucked last week. It's exciting hearing about the drama between girls that happened on friday. It's this constant source of mental stimulation. It's an addiction. This is why I don't think that I can handle one of these for any amount of time. I am chill. I like to just do nothing some days. I like to not say words. I like to turn off my brain. These new girls are the opposite. The further I go down this path the farther away I get from the virgin perfect christian conservative girl that I've dreamed about in Vida. There is just now way in the lord's earth that I could drop down to that level. They are genuinely beautiful women but the lack of drinking, the lack of debauchery, just irks me. It scares me. What am I supposed ot do with her if we can't have sexAnd there we get to tone of the paradoxes that I perform. I want this nice conservitive spontanious fun girl what is also wild crazy and adventurous. I don't think you can have both cakes mate. either shes a fun hoe or shes a fun virgin. I'm just scared of what I would do if sex really isn't on the table. I guess I could do things that I would normally do with friends. But ath"
what to do in life,2019-01-07 01:04:00,I have not written a post for the new year. Part of it is fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of not being able to get back to the people that are relying on me to do a job. Fear of not getting my expense report in. Fear of being completely and totally irresponsible and incompetent. I don't like the feeling of being that close to degeneracy. I want to either be an engineer or a hoe. I don't like managing both lives in the way that it is happening now. I want to live and breathe according to how I feel. I want the mental stimulation of engaging ins something hard but I also want to start bettering the world in ways that are more accurate and beneficial to the world itself and to the fulfillment of my personality. I get asked all the time by myself and others: what do you want to do? I will answer... I want to be a model photographer I want to be a travel blogger I want to be an influencer I want to be a model I want to own a business I want to live and work in Eastern Europe I want to teach pickup to some extent I want to be a coder I really just want to monetize my hoetry so that I can do this shit year round. It's boring to have a hard life. Lets have it not be hard.

"Hello, this is your therapist speaking",2017-03-18 21:17:00,"Part of me knows what to do at all times. This is the Chi that comes out when I am alone, when I go out alone and when I am alone. I said it twice on purpose because this is the central part of the hypothesis. When I am around others, specifically non-boss individuals, by self is overlayed with the old bullshit pussy bitch who doesn't know what to do or how to act and who needs advice every second when it comes to life and women. I stop making decisions. I stop taking action. All that is left is this strangely empty husk of a man who needs love and validation. I want to play around and pretend that the signs that are being sent aren't real. I want to pretend that this girl didn't just pick an over-drunk animal over me. I want to pretend that this nice lady will forsake her nature and lower herself to take me out. I am wrong and this will not happen. That is why you will not take a girl home. You are afraid that Morgantown and your parents are so strong that you value will be lowered to the point of no return and any girl you choose to return with you will leave you. That and you can't get a girl on a second date. Yeah, it's probably the latter. I am your therapist. I am your god. Listen to me and everything will be alright. Ignore me towards your peril. Leah Casto does not like you. Emily Collins does not like you. No girl in Morgantown likes you. That isn't a totally fair statement because you haven't met everyone yet but it is a factual thing to say. ---This is pussy Cheez speaking now. I really want her to tell me that she doesn't like me. I really really want that. Real nigga Chi back... I know what you fucking want but here's the honest fucking truth... won't get closure because that is the nature of the beast. A girl like this will literally drag you ad infinitum until she finds a full replacement, till she is 35 or till you have ended your life. You shouldn't wait for any of those things, especially not the last one, so the best thing to do is to delete her. You out here giving advice on toxic bullshit and won't take any of your own medicine. Nigga, she needs to be blocked. You have fucked it up enough. You have tried and failed. You need to let it go like Elsa. Let it go, my nigga, let it go. Now walk out of your bedroom door, pick up your phone, and block her on snapchat and block her phone number. Do it now. Good. Now you are free. Get back to work. If you need any more advice, just ask."
Life and Girls and shit,2016-02-13 20:48:00,"I don't know what my plan is. I guess to start my stream of thoughts, I'll start by listing facts. I will be going to Notre Dame to meet up with an old coworker. She was my favorite thing about that job other than the other woman I worked with. I can't wait to see her again. I don't know what my plan is with Vida. She is a fellow intern that started this Spring semester with me at GE. She is smart, funny... pause. I, in the past, have never used that adjective to describe a girl. She is in the thin clouds when it comes to girls that have actually made me laugh so hard that small tears come out of my eyes.Well maybe that's a small exaggeration but in general I'd say that she is exclusive. She is religious. I don't like that but these days, it seems that religious people are the ones that I agree with most on difficult issues that I actually care about. Se seems to break the deterministic idea that I have when it comes to women but in the same sentence I know that she is exactly the same. She will respond positively to action and confidence just like any other broad and appreciate you for being one of the few guys in the world who will bring it to her. I want to be that guy who will give it to her (for the first time lol) vur or some reason I can't muster up the balls to go up and be the man that I know myself to be. In fact, I've been having problems approaching women in general. I am trying to figure out the source of my issues but the more I think about it the more it seems simple. Inaction. That is my only problem Fear leading to inaction. Fear of rejection. Fear of hurting the ego that I've built up. Fear of damaging the persona that I have created. Fear of change. Fear. I need to just do. Nike, JUST DO IT. Easier said than done, I can tell you that much. But really that'e what separates the goods from the greats. The goods settle. The goods accept and submit to their fear at some point and stop growing. I pride myself as being someone who will keep going when the going gets tough or seemingly impossible. But lately I haven't been living up to the standard that I set for myself. I've been backsliding and I need to get back to that Chi who is up for anything no questions asked. I keep saying these things to myself and I keep making bullshit promises to myself and every time a pretty girl passes by i feel myself losing integrity. Bit by bit. In my brain it resets at the end of the day or right before the night but still. This shit have become a habit. Going out. Buying one drink. Talking to one or two girls. Waiting for the perfect loner. Waiting for the perfect groups to merge. I know all of the sayings, moves, techniques nad principles. I just need to execute. I now what do do , I just need to do. The more you do the more the messages and techniques get internalized. I need to go. I will go. Fuck Vida. At least for this weekend. If I end up wanting her after tonight, I will make sure she knows about it come Monday. I'm done playing games. I need to get on my no hesitation, press send, go talk, go dance shit. We'll see how it goes."
going live with a girl,2022-05-24 08:27:00,"treid going live today with a girl... didn't work out at all. first of all I had a hard dick the whole time. not her fault but it was what it was. The second thing was that she really just wanted to hang out. sure this tiktok thing was a way to it but it didnt work out.I mean it was fun... like fun but the camera angles were trash the whole time, and there was a general lack of focus and direction for the whole broadcastI'm blaming myself... it was my return case and not shit happened and idk if anyone really enjoyed. this wasn't my best showing and we gon do better in the future."
noona - no nut $22,2024-02-29 22:10:00,"I went out tonight. I met a girl noona that I met last night. didn't close.I arrived and she was dancing.. then the bar staff harassed me to buy a drink. i wanted to quit but i decided to continue and pulled oug 3k baht. I bought a drink and bought the couples drink that were beside me since they didn't have cash. I like to do shit like that.I went to go dance with her but she was plastered. It took me awhile to register... not sure why. I haven't really interacted with someone that drunk so it was surprising. also i had just arrivedwas a boring night. few hotties in there. would be interesting but you have to really be careful with predators in that bish. the girls that want to eat after and will order fuckin $60 dollars of food and leave you with the bill and no pussy. or maybe pussy.anyway, i pulled her with the line 'walk me out' and she obliged. once outside we talked and kissed. turns out she not wearing pannies. damn. and i almost had the pull. she acted way more sober than she was upstairs. I tried for guitar lessons and she said yes. and I had it. but then she insisted on going with her friends. She's 46.Doesn't want a one night stand. I am so close to convincing her to come fuck. but alas. i hold out hope. i'm believing in something."
"i'm mental and how I will change - lost lisa, gave up mary",2020-11-15 10:57:00,"Hello again.Chi here. I'm sitting in my apartment near the Tulskaya metro station in Moscow, Russia, plotting out my plan for life. Quick review of life up till this point. When everything started going wrong timelinegot covid 19moved out of school apartmentmoved back into school apartment but wasn't descreet and i was kicked out because one of the girls from switzerland was scared that I'd bring back the virus on my coat since i go to the club ofteni moved into a hostel that didn't check my documentsthat hostel was sold and i wasn't given a refund so i was broke and stayed on the street for two nights despite the insistence from mary, my girlfriend at the time to stay with heron the second night on the street, i left my things in the street to go to the club. when i returned my laptop bag was gone with my laptop and documents and many other valuable things.i stayed with mary for two nights she gave me an ultimatum to close our open relationship which i said no tothen i stayed with my friend who teaches english (billy london) i stayed there for a week during which i decided to enter a closed relationship with maryi got kicked out of there because i speak to loud when i teach english and in generali asked my sister for money and got this apartment in tulskayafastforward and i have cheated on mary a few times, but the last time was lisa whom i almost got caught with at the train station. because i almost got caught i decided to breakup with mary because getting caught would be an evil thing. (full story, went out that night with my jewish friend raz and mary to this club near novoslobodskaya called molodozh. while there it was fun but i didn't give so much attention to mary because i wanted other things. she decided ot leave eventually and that's when i met lisa. we messaged all night and met up in the train station the next day to drop her off at SPB. she missed her train and came home with me where we kissed all night.)i messaged lisa for several days and called her on the phone and talked to her for hours. she came to see me a week later on friday when she stayed the night with mewe had sex 4 timeswe had a lot of arguments in this time - she found mary's toothbrush and bra in my apartment and was upset. she was also upset that i was focused on my own problems and sad all the time instead of being focused on her and living in the moment. she thought i was egotisitcal and that i only cared about what was going on in my own life. at the end i told her two things - they were bad. i mentioned her that i never wanted to have sex again because it led to me losing people -when i asked her thoughts she said. ""i think you can tell this to someone else. anyone else."" i tried to figure out why she said that and she answered that basically i said a lot of things but none of them matched up. I am living in the vanity or i am vanity, a philosophical concept that she described as someone who does a lot of things but with no purpose or goal. she said she can't have an opinion on it because it is nothing and my words mean nothing. she then asked for a uber and left. so in the end - i have a problem. if i have sex with a girl, i lose interest or i lose respect. it's a wierd phenomenon. i can love or like or have major plans for a relationship but goddamn the second my dick enters, she's trash. i don't look at her the same and I don't want her anymore. it's so wierd. even with the famous sayora whom i speak of often. even with lisa who i broke off my relationship for because i thought i had love at first sight. now there's more to be said about lisa. i idealized her to the maximum. i projected this idea of her onto her and she regularly rejected it. i lived in this fantasy land of love with her. this was apparent when I met her at the train station on our third time meeting. i met her, put this purple sparkly wreath around her neck and tried to kiss her deeply. she gave a couple pecks but stayed away for the most part. when we went outside, i kept trying to get her affection and love and when she basically told me to shove it, i closed off and stopped reacting to her. she was upset by that and we had an arguement on the way home about how i am an egoist who doesn't care about the wishes or thoughts of others. I argued my way out of that but i think she was right. fast forward and i found out the reason for why she got so upset at me and hung up the phone - it was because her ideas and her art are so important to her and if someone isn't listening or isn't interested there's nothing for her to do in that situation. she isn't really mad, just done with the person or the situation. the other part of my idealization was her sense of humor - i used my normal make fun of girls shit on her... not on purpose but because it's something i'm accustomed to doing - this is what you have to do to girls in the usa in order for them to see you. this thing is when you say something that is negative but in a sarcastic funny way - the girl hears the words, gets a negative spike but also has a positive feeling because they know you like them and that it's not a real statement... just a joke. and she was doing it right back to me. the issue was that her humorous comments were in reaction to mine. she was being mean to me because i was being mean to her, not out of some matching self or other depricating humor. this came out later on when she asked me why i was so mean to her so often. I was so surprised by that. she also asked why i spoke about sex and other girls so often. i said i don't know, both the girls thing and the meanness thing are just my honest reflections about the world.And that's the problem. This shit that I've been doing for years and years has thoroughly fuckedup the way I view everything. There's an evil underbelly and an insidious intention behind every word that comes out of my mouth that moves me towards my unstated goal of mounting and fucking my prize. It's gotten to the point where I don't even see it anymore - it's a deep subconsious thing that I've trained myself to do in the english language. And damn i can see it now. It really is true that everything I say is true in the moment because I change my intentions from moment to moment. I have no real truth at any point because i change my intention and therefore my behavior from moment to moment. i can't be trusted."
the 2nd day,2017-01-02 15:28:00,"I found my phone. also my last post was dumb. I don't think it was especially insightful. Anyway Daygame is fun. I talked to 2 girls today. One was the general manager of the hotel that I was sitting in while waiting for my phone. She smiled and made eye contact with me twice when I walked by her earlier so I had to go in. I went indirect with asking about food choices in the area. She was laughing and open although I could feel that she had a time constraint (because she was working). I ran out of things to say and she didn't bite my one attempt to get some investment from her. So before she left I went direct with my classic, ""Also, you look very cute. Maybe we can get drinks when you get off."" line. This is my bread and butter. I looked at her hands first to check for rings but she then responded that she had a boyfriend. Oh well. I came. I saw something that I definitely wanted and I went for it. Also, got a great lunch suggestion although I didn't end up going because the wait was an hour. I then went to a cafe next thinking there might be one girl there that I can talk to while I have my coffee. Lo and behold, there was one, sitting alone flipping through the magazine thingy that was on every table. I thought that I would probably open indirect with her coat or phone. The issue here was there was no space for me to casually walk by and open her. This was a moment that I could have gone direct even through it's ostensibly high risk. Since high risk is actually low risk, I think I still could have won. Any way, I positioned myself near the door and opened with the coat line as she was going to leave. I powered through and got 3-5 minutes of conversation before she broke and said she had to go to work. Again, my investment hook didn't work. In this case though, I didn't go for anything further because I honestly didn't really like her teeth. That's petty but that is the way things are. Anyway. That was my day. Now I have to decide whether or not to stay one extra night here."
what do I really want,2015-02-08 08:58:00,"I don't even know what I want with regards to chicks anymore. I've not fully tried this dating thing. But forreal right now it sucks fucking dick. Or it specifically lacks the sucking of the dick which is part of the reason it sucks dick. haha. Don't get that fucking drunk then invite me over. I want to fuck. If you invite me over that late then it is to fuck. I really don't know if I'm capable of liking a girl for more than her vagina and ass. It's a very weird feeling. But you know the feeling I fucking hate the most? Out of all the bullshit that has happened tonight, you want to know the feeling that stuck out and makes me question the reason I still associate with people that have vaginas? Shame. I fucking hate being shamed. I fucking hate that her stupid ass shit actually affected me the way that it did. Granted it was a pretty fair objection. ACTUALLY NO. this shit was set up from the beginning . It was a fucking stupid ass test which I failed miserably. Fuck shit like this. This girl was drunk but spreading her legs like the making of a peanut butter and good ass jelly sandwich. I resisted for a little bit. I resisted the magnetism of the vagina but my dick was just way too close and I couldn't not touch/look at it. BOOM. ""I'm drunk, why did you look at my vagina?"" uhh why were you spreading your legs an shit? ""that makes me uncomfortable.. I wasn't ready for you to see that part of me."" Well shit. what do you want me to do not. apologize? I did. still complaining? what do you fucking want from me? you want to make me feel like shit while you elevate youself to some other shelf of morality/ fuck you and fuck that shit. But I felt guilty enough to stay even after all this shit and cuddle and finger her. thats some dumbass shit. she got to get her couple orgasms and what the fuck did I get? fuckin blue balls. so blue. ocean blue after the shaming and fucking dark black ass navy blue after touching the vagina but not being able to partake. This is some dumbass shit. I do not like feeling like this. Now I am wondering if all relationships end up boring as fuck and stupid like this one. I'm so close to MGTOWing it's not even funny. I would much rather whore out and fuck as many hot girls as possible with not so much as a thought for their feelings ot words or personalities. Just fuck the shit out of them and have a good time till the good times run out and we both move on to other humans. Even that has it's danger. But fuck it. That's where I'm at. Fuck this feeling. I don't like dates. They are boring as shit. Why can't the date be about me? Perfect segway into something I've been wondering about my self for awhile... am I a narcissist? Do I have narcissistic personality disorder? It certainly seems that way. I can't stop looking at myself in the mirror. Generally other peoples opinions and thoughts are stupid and don't amount to anything compared to mine. Most of the time everyone is wrong and I am right. I'm afraid I have this shit. Is it bad? after I'm done writing this I'm going to look up this shit and see if i really need this counselling or not. I think I will seek out some professional here soon. Anyway. I have one more thing in the works. Shes a very nice lady who works for the local radio station. She is very chill and doesn't go out much. Small red flag that she's from a military family and moves around a lot. That can have an effect on your ability to form relationships. hahahaha but I'm not really one to talk am I. Whatever. See how this rides out. Maddy Davis is also allegedly single. She's been the woman of my dreams for a little bit. I would love to take her out. She has the best sense of humor. She doesn't look like she would play any games with my heart and feelings and dick. Last thing. LADIES IF YOU DONT WANT TO FUCK EARLY CLOSE YOUR FUCKING LEGS. LITERALLY. IN THE OLD DEFINITION OF LITERALLY. LITERALLY CLOSE YOUR FUCKING LEGS AND CHILL. I would have been perfectly fine making out for part of the night and going home. BUT NOOOOO. THIS CUNT ASS BITCH HAD TO PULL OUT HER SHIT TESTS AND TRY TO TRIP ME UP SO THAT THE SHAMING SHIT COULD START. Sorry I'm not down for any of that shit. How long until I become a person? Who knows. who the fuck knows. I really want to chill with a nice girl right now. But do I even? after some dumb cunt ass shit like that I really don't know if I even want to partake in cuddling ass shit anymore. Okay seriously this time. later :\"
nigga go to an actual therapist,2017-03-20 03:13:00,"Some girls for me are just objects that I want to use for my sexual gratification. The second too much work goes into that is the second I am not living according to the value system that I have set up. I am selling dreams for pussy. I am not a piece of shit fuckboy so I really have to stop. I don't like this girl so I really shouldn't waste any more of her time. I know that I am attractive but as long as I keep doing this trash and using objects to get off I won't get what I want. Ranking of my favourite romantic comedies and movies. About Time - close to number one. My only issue is that Rachel McAdams is not my girlfriend in this scene (CinemaSins reference). Also, it was too easy. He only had to get his heart broken once and he got multiple chances at the girl of his dreams. The ultimate lesson of the movie is that you should live life with the enjoyment of every single moment. I cried at the end when the main character got to spend all those extra moments with his dad before he died. I don't want and will never have that type of relationship with my dad and the tears for me are from the movie but also Dan in Real Life - The message is that love is an action, not a feeling. If you love someone let them know and regardless of the situation, there is always a chance it might work out. Always pull up. Be real. 17 Again - Don't regret the decisions you make in life. Know the reasons that you ae with someone, why you love them, and what you have to lose. Kids need a father. Girls with bad dads are hoes. High School Musicals - great music. Vanessa Hudgens Planet of the Apes the Remakes because of the Caesar moment and Everything with Caesar involved after. Fences - I identified with the boy and his feelings about his dead father and his final fight with his dad. John Wicks because it's badass. Transformers because it was the first movie that I ever got to see in theatres and it's bad ass. Step Brothers because it is the first and only movie I have ever watched with a girl. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For this girl, you are done. It really is only when I get to the point of no return of my dream sales that I realise that I am doing something wrong. I am incorrect. And I become unhappy with my decision. I then have to lie and sell a couple final dreams to get out the situation that I put myself in. Bad. Let me go and try to use one of the free therapy sessions that WVU gives out. Maybe it will help. I don't know if talking to someone random about my bullshit will make a difference but maybe having someone that knows secret shit will be able to hold me accountable where I feel uncomfortable telling others that are close to me."
Field report - the gay nightclub,2019-08-11 00:41:00,"orange romper I met a black dude early on... If a guy immediately tags along with me he probably gay but it’s cool I didn’t have any friends yet and it was cool company. We walked to the Takoda rooftop ordered a couple IPAs and I did an approach of a girl with a half sleeve tattoo that leaning on the rail. It went well and she hooked but since she wanted to hang out with friends, I did an IG close and moved on. I approached a mixed set that didn’t really go anywhere. It was mainly jovial and chill. Then did another group set of 4 girls who laughed at a lot of the things I said. I was only interested in one though and I didn’t do a goof job of hooking her and she ended up being the butt of a couple of my jokes. I was mostly self amusing at this point. I started dancing and attracted a girl who hooked pretty hard. She had a brown leather skirt on. EDIT: This set hooked pretty nicely. I think there was an opportunity to kiss her which I missed. Somehow this fell apart. Another set where I commented on a girls spaghetti straps and made some jokes. Didn’t go anywhere. EDIT (9/23/19) The last set that I did was a really fun girl who was dancing with her cousins. She was extremely attracted to me. I danced with her at Takoda then, when Takoda closed, went with her, her cousins, and her gay guy friend to a gay bar nearby. We went in and this place was super gay. I've never been to a place like this before. I was definitely uncomfortable but I stayed trying to have fun. It was at this point that I decided to give her more space to let her see that I was a fun guy and I didn't need her to have a good time. I didn't interact with her a lot while we were there. At some point I think I tried to kiss her... I think I did end up accomplishing this but I don't remember since I didn't finish this report the day after... I do remember the one cousin being mostly sober and semi protective. He liked me and he was on my side but he was definitely very brotherly and protective of the girl. I had to watch out for too much or any PDA in front of him because of the way he was behaving. When that place closed, I went with them to get pizza. I tried to see if the logistics would allow me to stick with their group and go home with them... the way that the one cousin was hugging and holding onto the girl told me all I needed to know about the lack of logistics. I number closed with plans to hang out the next day / week. She never texted back. All in all, this night was a lesson in perseverance. Although the night started off slow and uncomfortable, I was able to build from that shaky foundation. I created something that almost ended with a close but surely ended with a good time for most of the night. I'm proud of this. Things I did well approaching a lot of people and trying ot make friends perservering through negative emotions to try to have fun getting through my uncomfortableness around gay people to pursue my goals Things I could work on disqualifying and getting girls to chase more taking opportunities to escalate when they present themselves, no matter how early in the interaction they may come"
Field report - level 0 8/22,2019-08-24 01:03:00,"I didn’t really approach anyone today. I went to UMD because I wanted to see how similar it was too WVU. It was the exact same... Packs of sorority girls roaming everywhere, underage girls with fakes everywhere, packs of dudes everywhere, cover at every club and no one at the clubs that no one was at... I got scared because I really have never been successful in opening a group of sorority girls and in fact, I don’t know anyone who has been fully successful in this. I would be experimenting fully here. These are the most dismissive girls out there so what is the way to get them to stop? I’m thinking doing a ‘woo’ from a distance Questions to ask after or while approaching college girls: How comfortable was the girl/guy? Were you putting pressure on the girl? **signs of too much pressure • Eyes looking tense • Nervous laugh • Taking steps back • You’re crazy drunk **signs of not enough pressure • Looking around • Texting"
the funny thing,2022-05-17 03:17:00,"I Amy lie to myself and the world often about the reason that I’m doing all of the stiff that I’m doing. I’m sure the reasons change as well but in general, if I’m not getting clout from it, I don’t see the purpose. The purpose in doing the things that I used to do, talk to girls, doing out and about, etc, has dried up to such a serious extent. I will need to go out and just force myself to do it because it’s something that I know that will be good for me similar to lifting weights and eating good. My ego has become large and my dick small… I haven’t tried a real level of shenanigans in a LONG time. I have stagnated in that round and for good reason… there’s no purpose in it. ironically though there is no purpose in anything so why am i choosing to not add purpose into this area anymore. my body has hall but rejected the idea of walking put to a girl. I feel stress about it and also seriously don’t want to do it. these days through, differently than the past, i feel that I have a good reason for that? it’s not just approach anxiety… it’s that I know that the whole time that I’m putting towards this pursuit could be put towards something worthwhile like editing or making a video or learning a new dance or sewing technique. The feeling that I’ve wasted (i almost backspaced that word out…) my 20s towards this pursuit sits beside the loneliness of being in this game by myself. I have the internet but the internet is only there when you are on the internet. and what are friends. I am frustrated and sad. I want to die. it’s just annoying to be here with a romper. I want to dissappear. I’ll practice tomorrow with my black hairspray. it will look like something.I hate this. The girl is right. We live and live through episodes of evil and death inside for one or two perfect moments every now and again and then wonder how it’s even possible that we felt like this ever. the cycle is laughable. retarded and annoying.fuck you.I want a partner in crime. someone near my age or younger who has similar experiences or at least enough to set out into this tiktok and social media world with me and win at it against the odds. girl or boy. has some extra skill set that would be helpful to me and balance out my weaknesses. the dream. maybe a girl and then i can knock out two birds with one stone and have someone to sex as well hahawhatever. also i think that fomo of talking to girls has gone away and i’m left with not wanting to talk to them but also not wanting to work lol and then nothing gets done and I’m sitting here with less than i even started with. Hoe or get shit done that. is nothing else you cunt"
Britney,2015-07-28 13:43:00,"damn it. every time I actually start to like a girl. Every time I actually let go a little bit and catch some feelings, that girl just stops responding. It is literally so difficult to do everything. How many times must I practice in order to get my calibration correct. damn it. Why won't she respond. I learn the same shit every day but I always fall back into my fairy tale dream of a relationship where the girl actually simply likes me and wants to hang out with me all the time and responds to messages in a timely manner. I hate fucking shit up. Sometimes i truly hate this gaming shit. but there is nothing else. This is it. This is the absurdity that comes along with living that was exhibited in the Myth of Sisyphus. The struggle of life is doing the same thing day in and day out and still keeping a positive attitude. the absurd is choosing to live in the face of meaninglessness. In this context, I mean the struggle of speaking to women. We are chasing this elusive k-selected unicorn of a woman that very likely doesn't exist. Ii might be done. I might be done trying to find something that is so elusive that it may not exist. I'm done wasting time. Now I might just 100% switch gears into full r-selection mode and try to have as much fun and have as much sex as possible before the day I die. That might be what I'll do. But we'll see. If this beautiful one-of-a-kind eye doctor decides to give me the time of day, I may consider keeping some of my fairy tale dreams alive. If she does not, then I'm switching to gear 2 and I'm not turning back."
51 + 52,2019-02-01 18:27:00,"I've fucked a couple more girls since we last spoke... One in boulder.. goddamn that is one hello of a story. I will have to write it out soon. In fact lemme get a quick synopsis now. I saw a girl in a coub. she was hot but I didn't approach. the club closed and I was walking back to my car when I saw her crying and frustrated. I offered her a ride home and drover her to boulder which was over an hour away. When we got to her house, she wouldn't get out of the car. I then went to a hotel, payed 200 for a room buz boulder is disgusting expensive and went in. There were 2 beds but she came to my bed. We messed around a bit at night but didn't do much. I did what artem taught me e.g. massaging to get her in the mood. It worked and she opened right up. We fucked probably 5 times that day. It was good. she was super sexy. One of the hottest girls I've ever banged. The when I took her home she started to remember shit and she found out that she was on zanny. that was kinda scary cuz idkl if girls can consent from that shit. Anyway it was fun. she didn't tedt back when I tried to hang out a few days later. One in colorado springs. a senior kkg poly sci major. she pulled up on me at the club. we danced kissed. It was pretty easy. I got her number and was planning on getting wine with her the next day. she texted me ""wine tomorrow?"" and I was like ya. and then she was like ""or now?"" and I was like ya. I went over to her place. a couple other dudes where there. I didn't feel bad but a bit empatheti to the guy that was hoping to fuck the girl that I did good work on. We went upstairs and fucked. she let me cum inside of her. damn. both of these girls I came inside of though the first girl did not know. Hope neither get preggo. Bye."
the high is gone and i feel depressed again,2021-04-15 16:23:00,"wild how up and down life and my mood oth are. I literally felt on cloud 9 yesterday morning nad the two days before after making my winning trades - I triple down to see if I can make somethign special and bam, all is lost. I now am back on earth looking around feeling bad. I miss mary, I miss my bed, and I miss doing nothing. I ride out and try things and I did some stuff today but it's literally everything in me to do things and forget the betterment side of things.I can do dance because that's a set modular thing. I make a couple videos, post them. it's simple and easy. I'll go to the gym even though I know after the first couple exercises, I'll likely crash out of hopelessness and sadness but try to do as much as possible before then. music helps not and conversations just remind me of who i used to be and who I'm not now. I just don't have hope. I just don't hope for something better. I just truly don't have patience for all this shit. With girls, you're rewarded constantly and there is no real end. you just start with some Ws and those Ws continue. Every W means something. trading isn't that. you win some amount. cool, you win another amount cool. unless it's a real number that i personally respect it's not anything to me... similar to the girl thing i guess haha. if i don't make out or something I just won't remember a single second of the night. but the process isn't so fun. it feels like time wasted because it is. so.and i keep thinking about her. god i just keep thinking about her. it's a fucking curse. it's a magnet. i hate it. i don't like living right now.fucki'm sitting in this office where my mom is getting her car fixed. i drove it here after i dropped her off at work. she is getting the back rotors replaced. my soul is melting out of my body and i can't keep it out of my body language or off of my face. i have to go now. i'll talk to yall later."
i do quit though,2017-01-15 06:48:00,Also why the actual fuck is a girl that I have been trying to have sex with favoriting my shit on twitter. She knows damn motherfucking well that I wouldn't be tweeting this shit if she were here right now. I don't want to play with other girls. I just want one nice warm female individual to spend time with and have sex with sometimes. I don't know how these relationship things work but I m willing to try and learn. They can't be that hard. I just want that. have said that now for the past several months and in several posts and I have even called it back in several posts. This is the 5th or 6th time that I have recognized the fact that I really need the experience pf a girl friend in order to improve my life I kneed to know what it is like. I need to experience a real fight between two people that are having sex. I need to learn how to eat a girl out. I need to figure out how to have sex efficiently. I do quit though. bye
Hi from Moscow - 36,2018-05-28 16:41:00,"I had sex with a Russian girl named like from Couchsurfing.com. I like Moscow a lot. Maybe I will go into it more but now I want to talk about my feelings. I am not feeling well. The lack of human contact in the morning is getting to me. I definitely need to get back into my thing about staying in hostels. It is necessary when you are alone to have some level of human contact or to at least understand yourself enough to enjoy this alone time.I don’t think I am able to adequately enjoy this alone time. There is worry. Yes I know it is dumb but because of my fiscal irresponsibility I have myself in a bit of a bind in that I have about 270 for the rest of the trip which is 12 more days. Let me repeat this. 300 for 13 days.Checking - 230Credit Cap - 42Credit Ba - 25So, we have an emergency budget. No more than 20 dollars a day can be spent for the rest of the trip. This includes housing. I know, it sound’s difficult but it is very doable, one meal prepay which is what you have been doing any way and stay in a hostel. When you get back to the US, you can figure out how to get to Pittsburg."
philochko conversation,2020-02-06 09:25:00,makes money by buying the girls photos and videos and uploading them directly to his own onlyfans.com page and patreon pages questions how much money do you pay the girls for their pictures? how soon do you mention this to girls you meet? how do you convince a girl to do this with you - is it just tell her how much money she makes or do you have to do some convincing how do you run these patreons - i assume you get all the money from the main patreon - do you also run the girl's individual patreons and take a percentage of that or do you run everything like the onlyfans page and give them 50k rubles up front for photos and videos?

pre mature end of year post,2017-12-05 07:21:00,"2017 is ending I did not learn Russian. I did not become proficient in West Coast Swing. What I did do is get better at off the cuff presenting. I killed multiple presentation in my industrial engineering lab to the point where I got an award (the only A) and pats on the back for being the most entertaining best presenter in the class. I did not get better with women. This year I regressed a bit and worked from the vantage point of a bouncer for most of the year. I had a lot of fun with this in Vermont and this lead to many interesting experiences there that I would not have had otherwise. This year was the first in a couple where I didn't increase my lay count from the previous year. There are a couple reasons for this. The main reason is that most of this year has been spent studying and focusing on passing my last year in Chemical Engineering. The second thing is that I want more. I want to be in relationships now. I see the value in them and I am tired of the streets. The funny thing is that I mentioned this at the beginning of 2017 and was unable to bring this to fruition this year. I think a big contributor after the spring semester was the fact that I was living out of my car and a tent in the woods. I try to pretend like this doesn't have an effect on my mental but it does. I noticed it today when talking with Jacob and Krysta (his fiance). I admitted to them my living situation but in a slow halting manner. Krysta called me out on this and asked why I was not answering the questions directly. She asked if I was ashamed. And the truth was, that I was ashamed. I knew exactly how he would react since he is such a nice guy. He wants to help just like most people when they hear about what I'm doing. I felt bad. I shouldn't have told him for that reason but here I am and I did. In general, I am perfectly fine with my decision. I'm not sure I would have it any different even if I did have enough money to live in a place. Housing was my biggest expense in 2016 and to be able to move that down to zero for the bast 7 months has kept me afloat. I'm truly drowning in debt and drastic decisions have to be made. This year, I have become more resilient and resourceful. Last year was a test and now I am living that experiment. For next year, I hope to be proficient at coding. I hope to have an app in the app store. And I hope to have several products selling well on amazon. I'm going to work as hard as I can to try to get a head start on those things this very month. Update you soon. Later boss"
Here comes the bus,2016-09-06 22:36:00,"Jesus Christ. Hello. I haven't been here in awhile. I am now a resident of South Carolina... at least for the next few months. I don't know what to do with myself. Well that's not completely true. I know to go to work, to eat correctly, and to lift weights at Anytime Fitness downtown. Those things take up most of my day. In addition, I am adding learning something new, writing in a journal (for safety), and not masterbating. But what about the girls you say? Isn't it weird going from a lot to zero? Isn't it weird being in a place with attractive females again? Yes as a matter of fact it is weird. And I'm considering becoming an asexual. A MGTOW (man going his own way). Here is why. The one thing in my life that has given me the most anxiety is what: women. Talking to them, texting them, calling them, interacting, etc. The whole shabang has given me more anxiety than anything else, other than my abusive father growing up. The one thing in my life that has gotten me sat down in an office alone with a higher-up: women. Complaints, uncomfortabilities, sexual harassment accusations, etc. It is a trend. Let me make this clear. It is not becoming a trend. It is a trend. It is a thing. I am scared. I am scared to interact with women in the workplace. I am afraid for my future. If anything kills me it would be this. The only safeguard that is foolproof is to go MGTOW. I don't need sex. Sex is bullshit. I don't like it anyway. It is not something that driving me. I have seen enough girls naked and seen enough vaginas and kissed enough mouths so really I'm done. The only reason... and I really mean the only reason that I am out here is so that I can continue the relationships that I have forged with my friends. The only reason I do it is networking. Building reps with the males that I come in contact work. My female roommate is awesome. But anyway. I really do feel that I have to make a distinct shift toward non-sexuality. Good luck boy."
to hoe or not to hoe - that is the question,2021-03-04 23:12:00,"i came to the conclusion that I want to fuck girls for the damn sake of it. I just want to do it. I want to spoil them regularly, I want them to forever love me.this shit gives me energy. it gives me thirst - when i achieve it, i feel good and after I feel nothing if I go into my head which happens often. I do think that it's possible to live in the moment and just bang new chicks and be cool with it. I know it will be meaningless on the back end but it is something that gets me out of bed in the morning. God cold approach just makes you feel alive. I hesitate out of a couple things. One - I have always had a basal level of approach anxiety. Once it's broken, I thrive but I have always needed ot break through at least one interaction before coming alive. The second is that I ahve already lived this life before... I puzzle if there is something else that I should be doing. If so, I'd like to know just so I at least have the choice. I want to bang some more but I also want to know the way out if I do begin again.and now is the perfect time to get help because I haven't started meeting girls again. It's really on a ticker for when I'll be fully back and in motion. I want to understand why I feel something akin to love to certain girls on the front end then stark nothingness on the back end AND whether or not its possible to change that. Depression and axienty about life will be fixed in good time - with that I would like to develop the discipline to see my dream(s) out to the end."
High Performance,2019-09-25 14:23:00,"The lifestyle that you keep trying to live requires you to perform at a very high level. In order ot pe prepared for the opportunities that life will keep throwing at you, you will need to keep your skills sharp in a variety of industries. You have always wanted to work as a bartender. Well here are some opportunities to do this thing, possibly for the rest of the year.

Make a list of skills that are needed right now and grind towards those. Bartending Teaching english Working out Coding That is all. Language learning will come out whenever you decide to actually go to whatever country you decide to go to. Women are always there. It can be a pass time that you always engage in and concurrently work on but be careful that it doesn't dominate your life and lifestyle. You've got to have bigger aspirations than fucking the next hottest girl. If you make a mistake or don't text a specific girl back, fine. Move the fuck on. Stop feeling anxiety about a dead relationship. Reflect as you always do about the situation and move the fuck on. It's a shame that the therapist never worked out. It's a shame that that girl in Budapest never saw you again. Cool. Water under the bridge and there are three billion other women waiting ot meet thee. On the real, it sounds flippant but this is the way that life goes. I love you man but your brain has this tendency to get stuck on some shit and completely stall out for days. Come up with a system and crack towards it like there's no tomorrow. Because there is not guarantee of tomorrow. This week is my last week in Morgantown before I'm going back to DC. Inform everyone and keep it moving. If you have to come back to get a specific thing or package, do so. Otherwise, keep running. No regrets. To get to where I want to go, I already made several lists that I haven't went back and created actionable steps for. This ends today. I have a bartending gig at a catering company. Nice. Go back to the bartending school next week and brush up on your skills and drink knowledge. Afterwards, go through lectures, create notes and try delivering said lectures. You have a week to get ready for this next big interview and a month or two to get ready for the big move and life change. Make the most of these last moments in America. And I don't give a fuck if that ad is targeting only women to teach. Sign the fuck up and dance with the energy that you've had this whole time."
the absolute moral good - icarus fallen,2016-06-07 21:16:00,"I am readin a book and in it there are a lot of interesting ideas that remind me of the class I took call ed Existentialism. Anyway, I just read a passage that talks about how the contemporary man is deathly afraid of identifying an absolute moral good. He is content with saying that the good is subjective while at the same time identifying and rejecting an absolute moral evil. The presence of absolute moral evil signifies that an absolute good exists and is being violated. Even with that being the case, the contemporary man still refuses to identify this good because he is afraid of falling under the imposed law and restriction of his free will that an objective good's existence would impose. I identify with this specific passage. It speaks to me because I understand the conclusion and the feelings that the contemporary man feels under the watchful eye what I perceive to be the objective good. I have been convinced that approaching random girls will make me a better person. Therefore, when I do not approach when given the opportunity, I start to feel a terrible kind of weight on my conscience, a guilt that seeps all through my body, down to my bones and prevents any kind of enjoyment until I stop submitting to my fear of approach or fear of rejection. I feel this every time I am doing something that I know is incorrect. The difference between when I was a kid and now is that as a kid I was under the constant threat of violence. That was what caused the bad feeling. Now, I have thought through a lot of different subjects and come to positions which hold an objective truth. These things which I know are good for me now guide me my path and correction occurs whenever I ignore these principles that I have created for myself. The issue is that I have not gone through and identified specifically my feelings of a lot of different things EVEN THOUGH that principle still exists and my body still feels the need to abide by it. In these instances, I feel terrible but I have no clue why. I know that one of my principles is/was being violated by my current of recent actions but it is an issue finding out which of those beliefs are on the line. Recently, I was feeling bad because I am almost running out of money and the reason for this is because I procrastinated on paying parking tickets and getting back to my credit card company to resolve my dispute with Enterprise. Procrastinating has lead to many of the terrible things that have occurred to me in my life (that's definitely an exaggeration but if has caused me to get terrible grades and lose out on several opportunities) and that is the reason why it has become a type of principle to me to not procrastinate. I still fall in the hole sometimes but I have been getting better and better at recognizing the instances in which I am failing and stopping that failure. Every now and again, I am haunted by my past procrastination and overspending mistakes. There is a habit that I formed of not caring about how much money I am spending and that is being challenged right now with the threat of me going hungry. Ridiculous. So, obviously, that is making me feel bad. On top of that, my woman boss, who I previously didn't have a high amount of respect, sends me an email. I did not have a high amount of respect for her because she looks and acts like many of the girls that have wronged me in the past. She is also my age and I technically have more leadership experience than her. She is not a good leader and she doesn't know how to delegate tasks well. She has two rings in her lip and they are extremely distracting and unprofessional. She also doesn't know how to put on makeup. All of this and then she tells me that I shouldn't have left a meeting early even though she was the one who told me to leave that meeting early. Now. I know in my brain that I should have not been looking at her this negatively. I should be trying the find the beauty in every person in order to maximize my success in the world and make my interactions more genuine and vulnerable. I know that this was probably just a misunderstanding and that it could (and was) be mitigated by a 20 second conversation on the next business day. Instead I got mad and told my friends of my frustration, spreading negativity and creating the view that I am the type of person that judges people in this was. I do not want to be viewed like that and I know better because I have been given this advice to not be negative and I have read and agreed with this opinion many times. I know that belief that I have in my head but since I hadn't independently thought about that in awhile and was caught off guard, I succumbed to the habits of old. But you can be damn sure that my brain knew about the incongruity between my actions and my beliefs and made sure to absorb all of the serotonin and dopamine so that I feel like shit until I fix that incongruence. Anyway. I just thought that that was an interesting passage and I like to find ways that I can identify with the books that I am reading."
the opportunity + the people that I will pursue friendships with,2019-06-08 06:34:00,"Nathan does not want to be my friend. I already wrote a post about this but now it is confirmed to be true by me. He has not made any attempt to spend time with me or hang out with me despite my multiple efforts to do so. I have to accept that our continued relationship has been a business partnership to help him make it the rest of the way in school. This is a breakup. At the end of the year, I will be ending the AT&T contract and with it will go our friendship. I'm sure he will continue to watch my Instagram stories like all the other girls and buddies of old, but the actual relationship will be gone. Sad but not all is lost. I will always have the memories of all those nights running the streets of Morgantown. All of the friendships, the rejections, the makeouts, the sorrow, the joy, the dancing, the phone numbers, the text messages, the videos, the parties, the hugs, the tears, the laughter, the approach anxiety. The end of an era. It ended a long time ago but now it is truly the end. I am on to something scary and new in life. I just got an email from Shopify that is saying that they will give me 5-15k for my Shopify store. WTF. where is this magic coming from? Now, this is also very scary. This means that I have to go 200% towards this thing. I have to start the youtube channel. I have to start making and recording music. I have to start going out and recording content for both instagrams regularly. I have to find a supplier for these rompers that Is reliable and consistent across designs. There is a lot of work to do. In other news, I think Ali Turner and I are officially done. And Ali Jackson and I are done. Two Ali's in one week I am more sad about Ali Turner though. I really feel like that was a deep connection thaere. I wonder what it was that turned her off. The last joke that I made was that I didn't know if I wanted to save her number... then I kinda hung up right when she was in the middle of saying something. And I did n not have her number saved in my phone which also definitely hurt her feelings. So I guess it is fair. But fuck it. I think that a guy would understand ... That is the reason why I generally can't hold onto relationships with this gender... they are so sensitive and get hurt and offended by the wierdest shit. The girl I marry, if I ever get married at all will have such a fucking thick skin that nothing that I can say or do will phase her. I will enjoy that day. I love girls who can bust a guys balls and recieve that shit in good faith right back. Lastnly thae fithis last season of black mirror was garbage. There wasn't much technology or thoughts what ere explored in these ones. It was mostly boring. What was interesting was the first episode and the virtual reality that went along with it. The idea that you would put on virtual reality and have your brain stimulated like all of those activities are happening sounds marvelous. Like, I can experiemnce a female orgasm by putting on this headset? Sign me the actual fuck up. Now the implications of this were interesting... like if two makle cjaracters are playing against each other but one is a female player and one is a male player, if they fuck, is it gay? Does it matter? I don't know... And i guess I don't care... It is an interesting funny thought though."
no cheerleading for Chi,2017-04-24 22:00:00,"This hasn't happened in a long time. I've been lucky for the past several years of my life to avoid the consequences of my mistakes in scheduling, procrastinating, and absentmindedness. There are some exceptions to that but really nothing that I care about right now. Credit card debt is probably the biggest thing but I mean social consequences. I have to write about this because I really don't know what else to do. I missed cheerleading tryouts. I really really wanted to do it but instead of writing down dates and making sure that it was on my calendar, I dropped the ball. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed in the potential of all that was before me. Everyday with small beautiful girls. Free travel and money to most universities. Game at those universities. So much potential, lost. I can't make all the shots that I was not able to take. I'm disappointed. What can I do instead? I literally can't think of anything remotely as fun and cheap as joining the cheerleading team. Any other sports team would require actual skill and practice. Fuck. Guitar Game Reading Coding Lifting French or Spanish This is all boring shit. I don't want to do any of it. Legit."
work work,2025-04-10 10:26:00,"Today has been touch. I've been actually all over the place since the morning... I sppilled a rootbeer on my keyboard.. and it didn't messs up the actual computer but hte keyboard stopped working which was an absolute bitch. This meant.that I couldn't login or do anything. I had to go buy an external keyboard. the only issue was that I purchased a wireless keyboard. I konw genius haha. So I wans't able to connect to it becasue I was unable to sign in ato activate bluetooth in otder to use it. So I had to bo bakc the othe store.Anyway, I had a work meeting with Klaudija today. It's hilarious how much she kinda discounts me. Super uninterested man. At the end of the call, I made a joke analogy thing like, ""okay when's the lates tyou need this by"" but instead of that, I said, ""whens the last moment you need this before you fly down here and punch me for not getting it to you."" And she said, ""I wouldn't. I just wouldn't."" and I responded with, ""I mean yeah not literally but generally when do you need this?""Anyway, it was the tone of the I wouldn't. And it was the fact that she said she wouldn't. I mean I'm just laughing at the level of this. And ironically, I'm in the same situation with Regina a bit. But it's just finy to see both sides. Still, I want to do it for whatever reason. People pleasing or something. Maybe I""m a victim of her attractiveness. Who knows. Probably a bit of everything. But you know, you don't have to exploit everything in this world. Sometimes you can just play a role. Sometimes you can just a simp. Sometimes you can just look at someone and be present. The future is coming. I will die one day."
after the motor speedway,2019-07-22 17:48:00,"First 4 hours of the day were wasted on my phone. I’m not sure what a good strategy to getting motivation or doing shit at the beginning f the day is but I tell you what, I really only feel like laying there and vegging out. Which is interesting. This makes me think that maybe I pay for my extroversion significantly on the backend rather than taking my break immediately like Artem or Jack. This could be a significant realization. This could explain why on many nights that I go out in in a row, things feel like shit but when I charge up, go out and suck for one night, ramping up to night 2, I usually have a legendary greatest night of my life. I still the the social practice and warm up but the extroversion energy is there and ready to be reaped. Can this be an unlimited energy that I can access if I have the correct balance of discipline and effort? Maybe. We’ll find out someday when my life is back on track. Right now I am stuck deadass eating ramen instead of real meals. I don’t even add meat anymore cuz that shit is probably too expensive. This is theoretical bullshit though. I hate having thoughts and questioning things in this way since it really doesn’t mean anything at the end of the day. The only thing that is a thing is action. Take action my nigga. That is all."
firn and feelings,2024-02-27 10:03:00,"I like that girl a lot man.I'm sad that a lot of girls are thinking I'm gay and just excising me from the optional dating pool. It sucks and I want to cry when I think of the lost potential. Why can't they see me as a man? I onw I wear rompers and I dance like a madman but holy shit.It feels like I can't be myself and get a girl that mutually likes me. I'm uncomfortable sitting here and clearly very frustrated. I feel that I can't express that though. It's an incorrect feeling. How dare I not want to be just friends with these women. And yet that's how I feel. I don't want to be friends with fern or with fai. I want them here, naked, and loving me for who I choose to be. I larp man. I larp a lot. sometimes the larp is what keeps me going. the potential. man.life really is all actual pain. like pain and discomfort and sometimes feeling okay and good. Mostly life is not being where you want to be and moving towards that but really never reaching it. I've been sleeping more this week. Frustration overall and lack of funds have pushed me to just relax. I can't keep going to sugar with no fucking game plan man. I can't just keep meeting girls in the exact same way and wondering why shit's not closing. Like clearly, the demo of this place isn't working for me. like I'm not quite hot enough ot pull a girl off nothing out of that place. okay that's fine. Now whatNow back to online dating i guess.Andy why do i even care. why am i even trying to do this shit. i hate women. do i actually? no. i hate that i can't access them. I hate the yearning, the pain at the top of my chest, the feeling of being tired all the time and the lack of messages in my phone. bro I've gotten like 30-50 instagrams in the last few weeks. that's insane to me. I guess there's even more to come. I need to man up a bit. but i'm feeling bad todayMan i like firn. but she doesn't like me. and that's the way things have to be"
I think I just broke up a marriage...,2018-12-04 06:58:00,"This title is what this post is about. Yo. What the fuck is my life. Here I am getting my portrait done and upon completion and on my way out of the door, this woman kisses me. The wife of Mathias Lelievre, the President and CEO of ENGIE. That's fucking scary. This guy is the head of a giant company and I just got caught with my dick in his wife's mouth. What the fuck kind of bullshit am I doing. The real question is how do I want to respond to this situation. Is this thing that I did okay? Is it okay that I potentially broke up a 15 year relationship with 2 beautiful kids? My reaction is no but my evil side is encroaching. Every day, some activity is normalized that I would have never thought myself capable of or even felt the need to go do. I now regularly sleep with women with no condom. That is a thing. I readily tried to fuck a man's wife with the full knowledge that he was a 10 second walk from the place where the activity was taking place. I am taking wild uncalculated risks that I would have never allowed in the past. I talk to people at work in a wild uncalculated way that precludes that they view the world the same way as me... when I know full well that most people don't and also that most people will not reveal their true feelings to you in the moment. I try to fuck married women that I work i.e. Gretchen Dubuc. I am totally and completely out of control and I need to be stopped. How the fuck have I continued this. I need to start charting degeneracy along with lays or else this shit will get out of hand. I am fine fucking girls with boyfriends and husbands... what I'm not fine with is putting yourself in significant danger where the man can literally find or slander you because your full name is on display in the public. And goddamn it will be interesting to see if the painting ever gets done... and if so the name that the painting will get. The name of the painting is supposed to reflect on the subject of the painting. HoeChi. HoeChi Min-ority. Is what I did okay? Yes. Fuck it. Just fuck it. I should have done it more safely but the actual action would have been what I would have wanted to do either way. I could and should have done it differently and better and for that I have regret. But for the actual action... actually that doesn't really make sense since the way you do the action has a lot to do with the feelings towards it. I want to detail and list the big impact things that I genuinely regret and would do differently in life. This is shit that I vividly remember to this day and wish that I did not. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE EVIL I HAVE DONE THUS FAR: SEXUAL THINGS WITH SISTERS WHEN YOUNG (MORGANTOWN FORMIDIVE YEARS) STEALING FROM WALMART AND GETTING CAUGHT (MORGANTOWN 2011) CUMMING IN A GIRLS MOUTH AND THEN LEAVING HER IMMEDIATELY AFTER TO GO MEET ANOTHER GIRL (MORGANTOWN 2015) PROMISING A GIRL I WAS GOING TO MEET HER FOR A DATE AND THEN GHOSTING HER (BUDAPEST 2016) CUMMING IN A GIRL, NOT TELLING HER, THEN BLOCKING HER ON IMESSAGE IN CASE SHE GOT PREGNANT (CINCINNATI 2017) CUMMING IN A GIRL, NOT TELLING HER, THEN BLOCKING HER ON IMESSAGE IN CASE SHE GOT PREGNANT PT 2 (ST. LOUIS 2017) MAKING OUT WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND LETTING HER SUCK MY DICK WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS IN THE OTHER ROOM WHICH LED TO US GETTING CAUGHT AND POSSIBLY THE END OF A 15 YEAR MARRIAGE WITH KIDS (BOSTON 2018)"
emy the nigerian,2020-03-02 00:53:00,"i ment a nigerian kid who was strikingly similar to my dad. Paranoid and untrusting of everyone that was not nigerian or his skin color. This paranoia manifested in several ways - he was completely unwilling ot have a social interaction with anyone that approached him. He was openly hostile to bouncers and drunk russians. It was leading us as a two person group into a place where we may have been denied entry to places and would end up in some sort of fight. He had truly negative energy and it was affecting my mood - i had to kinda shut him out in order to continue to enjoy myself. it felt bad to see him sitting in the corner but i had to understand that he didn't want my lifestyle - he was comfortable watching from a distance but ready to defend the brotherhood if anything happened. It's cool to have someone like that in your back pocket if shit really hit the fan... but in general, that mentality will lead you to hell. I can't imagine walking around being afraid or cautions of what people would do to me. Goddamn if that isn't an indictment on the culture of Nigeria, i don't know what is. I haven't decided whether I want to include him in further adventures - he's cool but like i said the energy just isn't positive."
Pimpin and expectations - 71,2019-12-23 23:45:00,"Pimpin and expectations What I think is so interesting is having conversations. I talked to two guys last weekend and they gave me some insight into their perspective on minorities and black people, specifically in Africa. One person said he visited Tanzania and it was weird for him. Instead of learning and bettering themselves, the black people kept trying to impress the white people in the hopes that the white people would give them money. Instead of studying, going ot school, and working, these people were focused on getting a free handout simply for their existence. Sound familiar lol? I see the parallels there. I came to Russia so I could get more validation for my existence. I was getting decent results in the US but really not the same level as I am here. This shit is different. And at the same time, I still have girls that are stringing me along, not responding to messages, and rejecting me. It’s insane that I can get a threesome one night stand, pick my phone up and have these other girls not even respond. I’ve talked about this before. It’s a weird world. I’m almost in pursuit of the ultimate end where I am not rejected by anyone and my status outweighs any bad game or lack of couth in my behavior. In my life, I am chasing a context where I can make as many mistakes as I want and do whatever the fuck I want and things automatically work themselves out within a few hours. Thoughts about this? I don’t know what else there is. I am happy here. I truly am. I can’t complain about anything. The only thing I’m scared of is that at the end of ten weeks, my students will not have improved. The only thing I’m scared of is that at the end of three months, I won’t be able to have a conversation in Russian. The only thing I’m afraid of is that I will make it all the way through the code academy courses and still not be able to land a coding job in Moscow. The only thing I am afraid of is that I will start to take dancing classes and quit in the middle just like I have quit with basically everything else in my whole life. That is what I am afraid of. So I shouldn’t use the word only. What should I do to mitigate my fears? I don’t know. Try and do all these things and see if you come out successful on the other side. And if you don’t such is life. I’m done promising myself shit. I will try my best to do shit and if it works it works, and if it doesn’t it doesn’t. Fuck everything else. Also I hit 71 today with Daniella Petrova, the beautiful Moldovan waitress."
qualify mate.,2017-09-26 18:00:00,"Dammit. Even obvious shit. You have to qualify and you have to do the qualifying as much as possible. On the former, the example in my life is that I don't want a career in safety. For the past couple weeks, I've anticipated the verbal response of the thought that comes along with that statement i.e. every role is a safety role and safety is everyone's responsibility. That shit is a fucking platitude and everyone knows the message and the sentence AND STILL if you don't make sure to come out the gate with the requested lines, you will be written off as someone who does not care about safety and the environment. This is the way the world is. You have to anticipate and come out the gate with the anticipated responses to people's worries and prejudices. Before citing any facts on black crime or women in the workplace, you have to prequalify the statements with a statement about how much you love women and the blacks, give a rundowns of your favorite black sports starts, share the phone numbers of the 5 blacks that you recently placed in your top 5, cite how you love your mother/3 sisters/girlfriend, and that the smartest person that you ever worked with was a black woman at GE. Before talking native Americans, you have to apologize for stealing their land, alcohol, and somehow, slavery. I understand that not everyone has my brain or experiences. I understand that these culturally true statements aren't obvious to everyone. but goddamnit can we all just have an iota of common sense just for once? Can we give each other the benefit of the doubt once in a blue moon? ahh. Here I am, complaining yet again about how the world is. I know how to adapt. I am adapted. I just tried to let go for a second and wish for a better world and got slapped back in to the seat of my plebian knickers. Wish for a better world in some other avenue mate."

I am thankful that I am able to be so mobile in my life. I am going to go move to Delaware in a few days and that is not something that a lot of people are capable of."
Nobody’s love is or should be unconditional,2019-07-24 15:31:00,"This is one of the popular cultural tropes that we regularly hear in the media and on TV shows in the modern era. This thing about unconditional love. Unconditional love means that there is no condition from which you would stop loving the person in question nor them you. Really? So if your love became a mass murderer or even a normal murderer, you’d be cool? If you found they’d been having sex and relationships with other people for the entire duration of your relationship, you’d still be in love? If they started physically abusing you, you’d stay? If their values changed and they started believing in a religion or belief system that was antithetical to yours, you’d be screaming ‘I love you’ at the top of your lungs and running home to fuck and create kids with this person? The answer to all those questions is undoubtedly a resounding no and yet this platitude remains and rebounds abundantly in our culture. It is one of those things that is nice to hear and bloviate about but it is also a standard that no one holds themselves to. As often as possible I like to call out shit like this for what it is, empty statements that make us and those around us feel good. It is the relationship version of virtue signaling. That shit has always been fascinating to me. All virtue signalers know that the others around them are also doing the same and yet still they all go around and pat each other on the back till the cows come home. My beef with virtue signaling is that no contemplation or thought or investigation goes into repeating what mass media has told you the correct opinion is. I understand that even for me, all of my opinions and thought have an originator that is not I. Even still, I strive to think beyond that initial sentence that is often spinned out by people intent on getting good thoughts form those around them. In the end, thoughtful reflection and expression from people who are breaking the mold is the shit that gets noticed. Saying shit that many people will disagree with will make you many haters and a few lovers. And to me, that’s the way it should be. And the funny part. The more polarizing and weird you are, the more lovers you end up finding in the world and the deeper your existing relationships get."
more on Anna Briggs,2017-07-18 21:32:00,"Sorry for the lengthy posts today. I just have a lot going on Anna Briggs (@nabriggs Instagram) is still on my mind. I know the main reason I haven't gone out and tried to replace the memory of her yet. I don't want to. She was wonderful. That was the first time I felt excited about a girl in awhile. That's real. I thought that it was the way that I had approached the situation. I don't know why the universe deemed this not to be.No. it was not the universe. It was me. I am responsible for my actions. My alone. Anyway. I don't think that I acted wrongly. Well, technically I did. I would qualify the sin and say that I acted out of calibration with what the girl was feeling. I didn't bother to test the waters or feel for an IOI. I just took action. and that has been a thing that I have been doing for the past month because I don't like thinking. Thinking has gotten in the way of a lot of things. I always over analyze everything and break life down into the lowest common shit until I can understand every section. And that is good for some circumstances but not in others. The others were the ones that I was more focused on. From my last post, I would have still gone for gold. That is if I had had a place to take them... That is the issue with working in a city far from where you live. I would have still tried things. I just needed to calibrate first. don't know if this needed to be said now that I am writing it out. It is common sense and makes sense implicitly. It didn't need to be fleshed out. I guess I just needed this. It is the case now for 99% of the girls that I will pull up on, they will want to fuck for awhile before they decide it is love (for them). I don't even know if this is just the current culture or if this is how it has always been. and as I always reprimand others on, don't complain and wish the world were a different place, deal with it on its terms how it appears right in front of you in the moment. Girls are on my mind because that is the way things are. I can and do change them when I want to but it stays that status quo for as long as there is not something more fun or pressing to worry about. conquer the bunny will be my motto and goal for the rest of the year"
Choices,2019-09-24 03:18:00,"I wanted to lay out all of my career choices along with the pros and cons of each. This is intended to be exhaustive and help me document and visualize the decision that I am about to make. This is what I came up with: China Russia USA Money Housing Learn New Language easily Social Scene Professional Training Pay off debt Dream Location Commitment level Job offer status # of cons 2 3 5 The disparity to me isn’t that large... It really depends on how I am weighting each of the choice criteria. If I weigh, all of them equally, China come out as the easy win. That said, depending on what I value more, a different option could materialize. Basically, I’m choosing between are financial stability and professional training with China and social scene and dream location with Russia. Well here we go Chi. You’ve partied it up across multiple continents for the past several years. The difference now is that you want to become a staple in the nightlife in Moscow and use your considerable social might to ‘take over’ or start in influence Russia socially in a way that only Philochko has done.... (There are definitely way way way more Russian celebs than this guy). The idea of becoming well known and great as a result of the work that I’m doing as well as the social points that I’m generating, appeals to me a lot. That said, I would be remiss if I didn’t go through the difficulty of establishing yourself in a lot of these different contexts. Sure, you’ve done well at certain clubs at certain times in the past. Sure you’ve made extremely strong connections with various people in Russia in the past. That says nothing about your future there. It is fucking hard to become famous. And done forget that there are times where you wither under social pressure and quit before your time has come. Don’t forget that you don’t have the musical skills to make it in the music industry there. Don’t forget that at some level you are just another gamer trying to get laid a lot of the time and to traverse that paradigm and become great will take grind and dedication to the cause. It will not happen overnight. Would it behoove you to get your personal financial situation taken care of before you embark on this significant sociopolitical journey? Would it behoove you to start making connections on the outset before diving in headfirst? Would if behoove you to stay even in your home country and develop yourself as a dancer, bartender, planner, and software designer before you take the headfirst leap into the unknown? All of those things are things that I don’t know the answer to. All I know is that I have a decision to make in the upcoming month that will change my life forever. Whatever I choose, will be what I do for the next year. This isn’t the biggest of commitments considering the option in the US but it still is a thing. Your next steps are thus: ☐ apply to some professional jobs in Russia - see if you can get any interviews and, if you can and don’t get the job, get feedback on what you would need to improve your standing in the future ☐ Apply to that 305fitness job in DC. This is one of the scarier things that you will be doing since it involves getting in front of random people and dancing. You’ve done public speaking before and you’ve danced in front of random people before so this should be fine... just live your best life and watch the cards fall into place ☐ Get another background check and see if that will work for your Chinese visa Based on the results of these actions, we will decide what to do in the future. Good luck Chi."
​In love again I'm yo girlfriends best friend (iPhone),2011-11-20 20:00:00,​In love again I'm yo girlfriends best friend I wait my turn if there is an end To this relationship and the love you two have for eachother An even though we closer than brothers I can help but wish for your misfortune And luck for me as I fine tune My game as it hasnt been used in years I stay honing it on her as I start to see the tears I soothe her and smooths away her fears And I am her savior and then as I take out my shears To cut through the single piece o twine that remains From the relationship so strong ur heart could barely contain You come back rekindling her burning passion And I was left with nothing my face left ashen And bare the thing I miss the most was playing with her hair No life is not fair
nothing - kinda expected though,2025-01-07 00:50:00,"didn't hear anything form old girl. i guess whatever date thing she went on went well.. i lovethe presumption lol. anyway, i thoght about her about 7-8 times... actually let me get the exact number.. okay it was 6 times. usually it was a pain - quick pang of understanding that it is what it is. but this is what the gurus say. you have to let it go. if it comes back, maybe there's a chance. and you know it's an interesting game to play. if you stop reaching out to people, when will they stop reaching out? that's the question. and it's usually pretty fast. i saw this video that i found funny. it was a guy pointing a phone at an attractive girl in the back of a police car. he was antagonizing her a bit and asking why she tried to run him over with her car... then it cut/stitched ot a guy saying basically all he and most people want is someone that loves or cares about them enought to run them over with a car. obviously a bit trollish but in it's essence, man i feel that. to have that level of emotion and love from someone even if negative feels better than nothing. but then again nothing is pretty nothing. the feelings are going. i fucked a whore yesterday. lolalmost forgot.it meant nothing and it was nothing. it's quite like eating an apple or watching a youtube video. there's a difference. i will note that i was quite quite nervous to go up there. and i realize why. it's interesting. there's 2 sides - first, the girls have to come with you. but in my heart, i don't want a girl to come with me that doens't want to come with me. the irony is that these girls have to - like they are in a context where at best they 'have to' want to or at worst they 'have to' but don't want to. either way, there's no true desire. and yet my brain still picks up on this. when i walked up the stairs, i was looking for something. and i realize, even when i go into the whore places or when i went into the whore places, i was looking for something. enthusiasm. acting. does she want me. that performance. you know i don't remember the sex with the whore before this one. literally don't remember. and i realize, most of the experiences that i've had are wiped. completely gone. i can't remember what it felt like to be inside of them. i can't remember the ass, i can't remember the peculiarities of each pussy. That is the only (well maybe not the only) thing that really makes me sad. it's that i'm getting old. it's that these memories aren't precious. or even if they are, they float away. it makes me sad that very quickly. so so so quickly, i will forget about klaudija. there will be a day when i don't think about her. and there will be a day when she doesn't think about me (i think that day has already come and gone lmao). how many times does one die in a lifetime. i am already dead for so many people. shout out to my nigga chad. miss you boithe homie died while i was out in life man. and i didn't know. how many other old friends and acquaintences are gone? yet, i don't want to feel responsible for contacting them. ah. fuck. man, i wish she would just call. i simply didn't do enough. we didn't get far enough. fuck you i hope she messages us. fuck."
the day after the day after (previously untitled),2016-11-21 23:18:00,"Here I am again writing with purpose. I want to talk about my lack of a serious or even quality relationship with a woman for the past year or so and the much longer trend of my life I had some girlfriends when I was at school. I am probably romanticizing it a bit but I definitely had girls I did stuff with once in a while. I could at least show up at their house unannounced and we could talk. They were my friends. I don’t have girlfriends anymore. It is all sex. My last girlfriend was Gabs. Jesus, I love and miss Gabs. And Vida whom I secretly loved more than a fiend but could never close or muster up the courage to get rejected by her. Flashback: I remember the first time I say Vida. She was extremely attractive but with minimal makeup. She had a beanie on but it was hanging slightly back on her head in a “bro I ski and smoke drugs” kind of way. She looked so fucking cool. I wanted to know her. I don’t remember the course of events but I remember that she was not drinking for some reason and thus stuck out like a sore thumb in the house. I kept trying to come over and make jokes and she laughed but only for that instant. They were real laughs though (unless she secretly has amassed a ton of knowledge on body language and is fooling everyone around her, but I am boing with Occam’s razor). I wanted to know her. Like know her soul. Damn I had plans for her. Damn. Any way. I don’t have girlfriends anymore. I generally don’t enjoy the company of women. Lol. That’s not true. What is true though is that I more readily connect with men and men always want to continue hanging out with me. My brothas, new and old, never lie, always text back, and keep the conversation on the stove. I don’t like hanging out with girls that often because it forces my brain out of logic mode and into emotional mode. Because women think through emotion and because emotional spikes and intent are the way to a girl’s heart. That shit is a lot though. You can’t just sit there and look at them (probably couldn’t do that to a guy either though…) because then they’ll ask why you are looking at them and expect a cutesy answer that they can brag to their girlfriends about later. Girls just complicate shit. And as I am typing that out I am aware that any given woman is a reflection of the man she is with… therefore I am the one complicating things and making relationships that I don’t not enjoy."
O-bitch-uaries - The MIstakes,2017-10-12 00:09:00,"I'm clever as fuck. Kristin Osbourne - I fronted and got extremely needy of plans and tried shaming her for not responding to my plans quick enough - dead Olivia - didn't make her work for it. There was no plotline to the relationship Vermont girl - Dove in and kissed her with no idea how much social capital I had in the bank And today - Cassidy - Needy for plans, kissed her too fast, forced actions i.e. driving to see her the day she broke up with her boyfriend and kinda badly kissing her in the rain. The interaction went from her doing all of the legwork e.g. snapchatting me first, offering up dates, etc. to me begging to see her and seemingly getting flustered when things didn't turn out i.e. reading her text message and sending back some shit that didn't have emojis. It's a sad sad day because I actually saw a relationship with this girl. Not because she was different or better than the other girls that I've met but because my situation seemed to be lining up well with hers. I truly do lose a bad bitch every day. Issue/Sticking point - I'm still operating at a low level of game. It has worked to some extent thus far because of my face and circumstance but it is also a type of game that blows up anything that isn't immediately working out. The neediness doesn't come out on the small scale. On the small scale, I am the most attractive man they may ever meet. On the large scale, the pimples start to show. The skin starts to fade. The darkness starts to show through. Sooner or later, the relationship succumbs to the traditional death that all my relationships have ended. I can't even be this girl's friend. I have no girl friends as of today. Gabs is kinda but she is more than 1k miles away. Can I even count her? This was not the first of my O-bitch-uaries and it sure as hell won't be my last, but let's hope that the problems start to change."
what is vulnerability,2017-04-23 08:05:00,"3rd post of the day but I have a lot on my mind. A lot of books say that the way to really connect with a girl is to 'open up' to them. What does that mean? Start telling a story about your past that is really fucked up so you start crying while you relive the experience so tat she can know what you went through? Someone please give me scenarios in which this is valid. Can I tell the story disconnected with the feelings of that moment? I don't want to relive a lot of that shit. The biggest worry is that now there is not a vulnerable bone in my body. I have pushed that nigga to the side or expressed it in my interactions already. There is nothing deep that you need to know. How can I disconnect telling my feelings to someone from saying a thing in order to get laid? Even when I am not thinking about getting laid, if it is the end result, that is the reason I did it and I rarely like the girl afterwards. If sex is not the end result, then I like the girl even more because she is ostensibly 'different' and is subject to different laws of physics. There are just no opportunities to be real with people. I feel like in order to attract someone I have to always go out of my way and act outside of what I consider to be my normal actions. At this point, a lot of outrageous shit has become known as my actions, but I really only consider the defaults because those are the ones that I know before game. I dance, I sing, I joke all in the pursuit of happiness and pussy Is there genuinness in that? ""Hey, what do you think about your parents' relationship and how do you think that it affected you?"" Damn boy fuck outta here with that real shit. What is real? I don't know what is real anymore. Is the real Chi the pussy ass bitch from 2012? Is the real Chi the genius introvert of 2017? Is the real Chi the extrovert Casanova of Europe and 2016? I have levels and states and opinions that change a lot. What is genuine can change but that doesn't change the truth of the expression of these values in the moment. Do you man, do you. In the moment, if you feel something, say it. I love you."
Paige,2015-03-09 00:26:00,"Real quick post on Paige. Very nice girl. I'm very interested in learning more about her. She's very closed off. She's one of the coolest girls that I've met. Always with the jokes and very sexy too. Something went very wrong back in the day though. She has no respect for herself. I'm not going to speculate about what happened by I will assume it is something pretty bad for her do drop all self respect and stay with a guy that even she labels as a 'fuckboy'. I just watched 50 shades of gray. The abuse in it was definitely blown out of proportion. I mean the girl literally asked for it. She consented. And then she booted the guy. Paige condemned this movie as disgusting. So my question is: does a guy literally have to beat your ass for you to get the fuck out? Does your fuckboy of choice have to take off his belt, bend you over, and hit you as hard as he can while he forces you to count along for you to say... hmmm I deserve better than this? This stupid shit is that there are some many other fine specimens right in front of her. And it's not one of those nice guy bullshit. I made it very clear what my intentions were with her from the beginning. But she chooses fuckboy regardless. Oh well. It is scary for her though. This is the type of girl that will most likely end up poor and destitute or rich and lonely. Either way, unhappy with a shitty guy who beats her or isn't worth the shirt on his back. Probably end up a single mother contributing to the fucked up-ness of the world. *sigh* mini rant done"
i was doing great - then i lost on my options play (i miss mary),2021-04-14 21:42:00,"I was having the time of my life the first two days this week. i was up 7k on the 5600 that i had put in and i was feeling myself. getting cocky. talking shit. and as they say, pride cometh before the down fall. jesus please bring the stock back up so that I can keep my big W. please. god knows you're the only one that can see this.and i'm noticing the way that my brain in working. I fixate on this. it's my number one thing to come up with a plan to cix it and i want to do that in leu of everything else. what's dumb about this is that i will have texecute the plan at the end of trading tomorrow which means that I really don't need to look at the stock or think about trading till 2pm tomorrow when I have to make a decisionnaturally though, it hurts. it hurts to see your account down. it hurts to see your free money given back. It's cool to understand that you might have something figured out but it sucks to be punished for your gumption. how my brain works through is that I immediately flash towards comfort. what can I do to be more comfortable. one thing is dancing. I did that and it was fun and distracting. another is girls - but not any girls because approaching will give me excitement/anxiety on the front end even if just for a little bit at the though of the sociability. no, my brain flashes to the comfort of the last year. the beauty of my ex wife and the times we had together. i looked at her instagram and just saw all of the amazing shit that we did. and wow. we were fucking awesomei was fucking awesomesucks i can't just call her and be a cunt and tell her that we can be together and normal again. sucks that i can't do that. I miss her. I miss walking with her. I miss being annoyed by her. I miss yelling at her, kissing her, laughing with her, crying with her. I miss it. and i wonder all the time, why did i give that up. sure it wasnt working but who says you can't just make shit work. you can.but it's dumb - my brain will have one ostensible problem, realize it can't be solved, flash to comfort, see that that problem of the girls can't be solved or that i don't want to solve it, double down on the little pain.now i'm going to dive so far into russian, i won't be able to speak english at the end of the fucking day. i want to start my russian instagram. upload 2 videos there every day. one dance video to my main instagram, and possible one talking head video to my youtube channel.survive my brother. enjoy the process or at least laugh at the absurdity of it."
goddamn it - didn't get the infosys job,2019-09-07 21:44:00,"Damn. Another rejection. I wasn't ready. I could have reviewed both java and python and been knowledgeable in both languages. I had a week to prepare and I already reached a beginner level in python and an intermediate level in Java. Just a light refresher and redoing a lot of my old projects would have done it. But here I am. Standing here. I have one more job app out for Nalco. If I don't get that one, I don't know what I'm going to do. That is why I'm writing this. If I don't get the Nalco job, the unreasonable ESTP version of me says forget credit debt, apply for loan deferral (done), and move to Russia. There is a job fair in WV on 8/10 but shit, I mean I don't really believe in signs, but this seems to be a big enough sign to fucking get out of the country. That said, I still don't really know how to teach English. That is the big scary part of this whole thing. And just like both coding jobs that I should have gotten, I've been given an inordinate amount of time to prepare. I need to at least fake teach some shit every day until I know what I'm going to be doing next. Fucking 10 minutes a day at least. Take some lesson from online and practice it without feedback. Get in your wierd bag. I'll talk to you later about this. Lordy lord. Life is wierd. Some random guy knocked on my window this morning and asked for a ride to work. He looked very non-threatening so I let him in and took him to Adams Morgan. I couldn't understand a lot of what he was saying but it sounded like he had been rejected by his girl and his friends recently. They thought that he had been doing drugs and had started judging him and treating him negatively. He really just needed to talk to someone so I just listened and gave sounds of active listening along the way. I didn't try to help him. I just listened and prompted him to speak further as much as possible. The same general thing kinda happened last night with the therapist girl. While we were lying in bed, I did the lion share of the talking since it seemed like she wasn't willing to get into anything deeper about herself. I never know if this is the correct thing to do or not. I ended up finishing the sex with her but this could have also easily been out of her feeling bad about me not getting off yet. I kinda felt that she was orgasming but I wasn't sure and my arm always gets tired when I'm fingering hard. There was blood. There was also white discharge. God knows it could have been cum from another dude but in my experience this is shit that comes from girls being on birth control. Whatever. Life is weird. I just have to stay busy and get better at certain things and I will be happy. Staying busy towards no goal is a recipe for disaster if that business ever stops and self-reflection is allowed."
Work and Girls,2016-02-10 15:33:00,"It is time. It is mid-internship where I always reach a crossroads. It is a moment where I get tired of all women and get tired of all work and start to slack off in both areas. This is the time of mobilize.This is the time to plan out things and make changes. The most fun weeks are coming and it is up to me to make sure that they are as memorable as the weeks I had in Baltimore. What separated me now and me in Baltimore was how much I cared, I ahve been able to reach some level of God mode a couple times this year but I fear that these heavily had to do with outcome. I am focused on outcome instead of having fun. I understand that outcome has to be a factor at some level if you really want to succeed but at the same time, I can't let that separate me from having a good time. My goal is to reach a level of comfort with myself each night where I can comfortably approach cloud and survive mentally. I need this. I will keep this going at least until the summer and then I will decide. Most likely game has to remain an integral part of my life since it has made me who I am today: a boss."
The diminishing returns of hoetry and why I must move on,2019-08-14 21:45:00,"There’s nothing left here for me. I’ve had this thought for a long time but it really came to a head when I was first in boston in 2018. I thought, If it wasn’t for the people I’m with and the places I’m going, I wouldn’t be speaking to these new girls. I wouldn’t be going to the club till 2 am. That is not to say that everytime I partake it isn’t fun… but there’s an opportunity cost associated with these actions that until now I have been comfortable with. Shit in order to get here in the first place, I’ve had to sacrifice so much. My finances, my muscles (for the first few years), my grades, job performance the day after a night out, and time. So so so much time has been put into meeting new people and becoming a person that I could be proud of. And I wouldn’t change any of it for the world. This shit means a lot to me. I’ve learned so much and made so many lifelong friends. Here I am 6 years later. I’ve slept with 59 women which isn’t crazy but it’s a lot more than the average. I’ve traveled to over 15 different countries. And I’m tired. I’m tired of going out till 2am or 6am. I’m tired of going through the process of talking, dancing, joking, rejecting, etc. I’m just tired. That’s not to say it isn’t the most fun time ever whenever it happens. It’s just to say that now I’ve begun to think about the other things that I’m leaving on the table to pursue this fun. That said, it’s a bit meaningless to say that you are going to quit the game. Game is life. Human interaction is life. This shit will follow me wherever I go for eternity. The knowledge that I’ve gained will always be in my head. I don’t think that I have the skillset anymore but the mentality that will lead ‘yes’ girls to wherever will stay. I just don’t see the point of grinding so hard to get and maintain that skill right now. And, just like any skill, I’m finding that neglecting it makes you rusty and coming back is equal times easier and harder. Easier because you know all of the steps, principles, tips, and tricks to remove the blockages from you mind the prevent action but harder because of the ego that can be built up… When you have so much knowledge and you’ve experienced success in the past, those experiences get built up and there isn’t a natural garter to prevent your head from swelling and thinking that you are too good for the basic shit that you used to do to stay afloat. I love this shit and I always will. I don’t know what form my game will take in the future. Most likely, I’ll have to ball up and start talking to girls in the day time whenever I see the opportunity. Most likely, I’ll have to leave this country to keep the general novelty of love and going out to meet girls real for me. And in America… In America, I should be done. I just don’t get enough enjoyment from the acts that I take, and I don’t have a solid enough skillset to make it worth it. My analogy is this: sure, I love soccer. But is it responsible to be paying to be on a team when I am just showing up to games to take some passes, knock some people down, and score once in red moon? No. According to the analogy, I should start practicing this shit so that I can score more often when I get put into games. And I just don’t enjoy the practice anymore. Mayhaps I need a break. But I also could take a hiatus from the whole institution. I believe that is the biggest reason that PUAs who’ve been in the game longer than 5 years turn to teaching. It adds something to the game. Money. So game becomes a job and thus every time you are going out you are cross promoting yourself as a sex/relationship option to the women and a sex/relationship expert to men. Going out is business and pleasure. I just don’t have the know-how, the work ethic, or the desire to start something like this. So here I am. Writing about some shit on my secret blog for the billionth time. Hoping that this time things will change. Hoping that after walking back to the gym and uploading this I’ll have the will to make the necessary changes to my life to accommodate my official feelings on this subject. Hope is bullshit thought."
mary and lisa,2020-11-09 23:29:00,"i met lisa on friday and broke up with mary on sundayI think i may have found love or whatever is closest to it. The way I feel about this new girl is something isle. That said, somethimes in fleeting moments i I feel that I may habe made the wrong decision. The lifelong struggle: whether the follow the head or the heart. The gut or your logic. I went with my heart this time. I think that if there is any chance that this thing with lisa is real love I have to try it. And this is also a chance to do things purely. With mary, I made so many mistakes and often didn't treat her like I should have - even with all of that we still stayed together, making it through some of the toughest times of both of our lives. I feel remiss leaving her but I am leaving her strong. She is ready to handle life and ready to live without me. She will not cry over me anymore. She is good. She is strong.It makes me sad all the same - and it makes me regret the sex. Why did we have to have sex? We could have traveled all over and even been best friends and never had sex or even kissed. I could have been pure and I would have gained a forever ally. instead I chose the 50 or 60 times of fleeting loveliness. I traded this temporary thing for what could have been forever. But i needed to make that mistake. I needed to know how valueable sex is and what the cost of sex can be. I am really thinking of remaining virgin with this new girl until the day we get married or do something different."
daygame to sex... I just realized I did this,2017-03-27 18:59:00,"New york over thanksgiving break. I opened only one girl on the street and I turned that into sex. Incredible. I don't know why I don't do shit like that more often. I get so much validation toward my efforts across the board in the game. I suck and suck until I don't suck. And that is all. I am not Chad. I am not Nate. I am not Dustin. I am Chi. I have shit that works for me. the shit that works for me won't work for others and the shit that other people do can't be applied to me (generally I know that there are a ton of exceptions). Boss up nigga. You can't compare your experience to these other people. You know yourself and the things that you need to do to stay lit and to keep your head in the game. Friends and other guys break you out of that zone. 5 people I spend the most time with Nathan - history, brother, has girlfriend and doesn't push me to approach any more Chad - connections, values, boss, doesn't cold approach, needs alcohol to talk to women, I find myself comparing myself to his successes instead of creating my own Dustin - history, my white brother, needs alcohol to talk to women, I get sucked into my old habits like hating women and experiencing the night negatively and experiencing rejections negatively Alex - chemical engineering, bonding over differences and acknowledgement of our flaws Nima - history, can't overcome negative thought patterns"
Field Report 8/20 - Another Panera,2019-09-22 01:52:00,"Damn I am on a roll. I want to keep this one a bit shorter. I was doing some coding at the Panera in my home town. I had done a few approaches in the Panera already - just short conversations with random people. One was a business man that walked in - found out he had just come from a board meeting at the hospital and was continuing his work with another meeting at the Panera. He owns a jet. I went from there to walk back to my feet and I kinda bumped into a mother and her daughter. I talked to them about speech pathology and audiology, the field that the mom was in and that the daughter was studying. It was a bit flirty but mostly harmless and interesting for both parties. As soon as they were dismissed, one or two girls in the college volleyball team from Duquesne complimented my outfit. I used that to open the whole team as a group - they weren’t very receptive so I went through another couple back and forth and dipped back to my seat. After studying for a bit, I moved outside where it was nice. While I was out there (facing the inside of the restaurant), a girl made eye contact with me. She was getting a straw for her coffee. I thought I saw something in her stare but I chilled for a sec. I kept looking at her and when she looked up again and saw me looking, she flashed a sexy smile and started walking toward the door. I immediately took off my headphones and cut her off before she got to her car. She said she just got back from the gym. I invited her to come sit and drink her coffee / eat her salad with me. She obliged. We talked for an hour or so before I asked her to go on a walk with me, when we stood up, I made the move and kissed her a bit. She suggested that we head to her car, where we made out for awhile. Things escalated and though I suggested we go back to her place and drink red wine (still don’t have a place to stay), she was hesitant to take things ‘all the way’. She seemed to just want to make out. I said cool. We switched parking lots either way and things heated up even more. We fooled around but never got to sex. I got her number and mentioned that we should meet up tomorrow. She obliged. ---SUMMARY I think I did everything right this time. I made the move, escalated when necessary, and made her feel comfortable every step of the way. Suggested improvements • Seed the pull more confidently and when the arbitrary time comes, make the move. (Here I seeded but didn’t unwaveringly commit) • GEN NOTE: while I have become pretty decent at seeding the pull back to the girls house, it would be much more dominant and easier to pull to a domain of my own"
on the edge of magic or death,2020-08-01 14:50:00,"I'm at the best and worst places in life - on the one hand I'm being drowned in opportunities when it comes to businesses, girls, and opportunities. On the other hand, I have this big self esteem issue about being able to make change and accomplish things. I have been on a trend of fucking good things up or not following up on them for long enough leading to the thing just fall apart. The amount of jobs that I've been fired from is insane and even bigger, the line of people that I've disappointed because I woke up late or didn't feel like doing a thing that I said that I would do.I'm at a crossroads. I'm at the highest point I've been in a long time. If I can accomplish the things that I've put out there for myself, I will become the king of Moscow. If I fall back into the rut of not doing shit and fail at these things, I will quit all of this and head back to the west for a normal job (originally I typed kill myself, but that's just dramatic).It's that simple. So here goes nothing. I'm supposed to move in with mary at the end of next week and start trying to make her a camgirl. Can you imagine? I'm supposed to put together fitness dance workouts and make this into a legit business. I have an audition on Monday that might break me into the acting world. And on top of everything, I have this slang school idea that can bring me some freelance clients. Don't fuck this up."
is there any way to prevent us from acting according to our nature,2018-10-23 15:33:00,"I often feel not good about the world when I and others repeat the mistakes and low vibrations states of the past. I should know by now that the most fun cunt wins and that unless you get an explicit fuck off, you continue until the bell rings. who gives a shit. Continue. The thing that blocked me from that last night was the sense that I think that I developed that detects when I am not wanted around. There are too many girls on the planet to fight through a girl who wants to play super games. If it is the end of the night, you can try to whether it down but for the most part, it's not worth it. Ironically enough, it's the women who you would expect to be the most promiscuous, the girls will full sleeves, multiple tattoos, and more than 1k followers in Instagram are the ones that are the most difficult for me to get. That code, that blueprint of the girl who has options. That is the girl that Ihave struggled with. Every girl has options but the ones that have kicked 26 and are facing down the rest of their lives in denial of the incoming cliff... that 's my demographic. Not in as high demand as they used to be and willing to get with the most fun dude that is in the club. I will say though, it is hard to maintain that energy. I seeped back into my head after we reentered royale and I really wasn't able to exit all night. It was a genuinely uncomfortable experience. I didn't really press anything though. As a coach, I would have told me, ""Okay, this is really your chance. You ahve been practicing dance with me for that past few seeks. This is the type of music that you like. Get into your dance bag. Don't look around the room. You will be getting validation from the reactions but the bottom line is that it is not about that. You have to be able to generate safety and security from within continuously and regularly or the club will eat you alive. The club, in essence, is all about state management. Can you keep having fun despite there not being as many sets as you hoped? Can you keep going after the latest girl ignored your advance? I notice that the shit that EV is able to do or just says that he is able to do is something that I can't get into yet. The kind of dude that hands his phone off to another person and ready's the world to react, I never really wanted to be that guy. And at the same time and int he same sentence. I really want to be that motherfucker. It is starting. The hunger. The pain. that feeling that turns good men evil. This is it. As for the topic of the post, Gabs, my oldest and only girlfriend is steady getting hurt by fuckboys. And she can't break the cycle. I don't want her. I keep having to remind myself that I will not never not ever have sex with her. That being said, I can literally see how all of my actions directly mirror a beta bitch boy who is waiting around for the scraps of some BS once in awhile. The shitty part is that I can genuinely say I love that girl (like the brotherly or family type, fuck you nigga) and I care about her feelings and her life... in the same way where if a guy that I am friends with is fucking around and doing shit that will be to his detriment, I will intercede, I am interceding now. The paradox of that is that the actions that I should be taking and the things that I have said now and in the past do the opposite of what they are intended to do. Logic is not what is at work here. Just like it is hard to impossible to convince men to wear condoms after experiencing what heaven feels like, it is hard or impossible to convince a women our of her drive to find fun and rollercoater type of bullshits from the closest alpha male or at least the most convenient cunt nearby."
"hello chi, what would you like to become a god at?",2019-07-30 17:36:00,"This is a real question... because time and time again, I get exposed to the amount of dedication I really need to become great. I could become great at anything... it is literally my choice to go down the 6-month road of grinding The problem is that I can't go with longer than 3 days with a different lifestyle. But I'd like to. The question is what do. I want to become a genius at. My options: public speaking/comedy, picking up girls and creating content around that, playing guitar and mixing music, and coding. Those are the things that I am currently in that I enjoy but haven't jumped out of the closet on. I think they are all probably equally hard and will be equally taxing on my heart and intellect. The picking up girls thing would be much more meticulous and I have a big ass head start on it so it would very quickly start generating life changing results just like in the past. Public speaking and comedy are areas that I haven't done much if any work in. I have thought about dabbling or trying my hand at it but damn it would be an exercise in not caring about the abject failure that I would experience regularly while working on the craft. The guitar is also something that I have been working on for a long time. If I get a lot better and practice every day for 6 months, I would be good enough to join any band and good enough to improve my songwriting ability. Coding is something that I have taken many forays into but never jumped out of my skin into. The hardest I ever went was all of the hours that I spent back in my junior and senior year creating apps from swift tutorials and making my final project for the CS111 class. It was fun but I can really see the academic suffering that I would have from trying my hand at this. That said, this would be the biggest and best thing to do for the idea of roaming around as a professional careerist digital nomad. What do I do? It depends. I have other thoughts and goals that prevent me from really jumping out of the window. The biggest thing is the 400 dollar a month bill that I have for loans. That shit is a bitch and the work that I have to do to to keep that off of my back always creeps in and disrupts my plans towards one of my greater goals. I could still do any of these despite that. I am afraid though. I know the pain period of rejection will be 2-3 weeks and I am just dreading the initial feelings of failure and worthlessness that while temporary, would not feel great. Nothing that is worth it is easy though. Fuck me on all of this. I need to pick one and dive the fuck in on it. Shit. It will probably be the girls one since that one pisses me off that I am not the best at it at the moment. I am good but I am not the actual best. So leggo."
I don't have time for this,2016-10-20 12:55:00,"Dude. you know I'm only here for a limited amount of time. You know how time sensitive this shit is. I was promised this information last week for Friday and I get it 5 days late. Fine. I'm not okay with that already but fine. Then, Then you decide to spring it on me that not only were you late on getting this quote to me, not only have we been having this conversation for the past 4 weeks but now you want to tell me that I have to wait another four weeks to even get a PROTOTYPE of the goddamn design. You've got to be mad. You've got to be a basket-weaving nutcase to think that that is somehow an alright way to disseminate information in this context. You are what I dislike in the earth. You are a fuckboy. You are a piece of shit. I am very displeased and I would love nothing better than to shun your company and have you go out of business as a result of my shunning. You need to stop doing shit like this. Everyone does. Do not ever tell me a date that you will have something done by and then tell me on that day that you don't have it. Don't do it. Just don't do it. fuck you."
Emily Rector,2016-11-22 21:33:00,"-----Update 10:50 PM on this Post: LOL I have a date with her on dec 16 before I leave the country. Pls cont. reading though----- *Start of original @ 1:33 PM* I have the tight feeling in the back of my throat again. I don't feel good. It is a combination of things. When I came in today I was extremely sluggish for some reason even though I had a long night's sleep. Part of that is definitely due to me feeling bad that I haven't been to the gym as much as I'd like to be. The other part is that I am not being as productive as I'd like to be. The other part is I feel like I am still incompetent with women. I want to focus on the last point for a second. The truth of the matter is that this is true: I am still incompetent with women. I am incompetent in the only area that I really cared about in the first place: getting in a relationship with one. It should just be an extension of ... pause to accept my student loans... It should just be an extension of the initial meetup and coffee excursion. But for me it is not. I am crippled by my own neediness. I feel the need to to shit that is unnecessary. The shit that prompted this post is that I sent Emily Rector a message that asked if I could call her. Not a big deal I know. But it was unnecessary. I am not going to see her anytime soon. I am currently also busy being a hoe. I could've just as well said congrats and left it at that. Shit and it was a double text. I overthink shit too much too. Maybe a good policy is just to not text girls when I am in logical mind. Leave all girls alone until you have gamed somewhat in that day. Which is almost an unrealistic expectation since I don't game on a regular basis. My goal when I set out going out alone was to be able to turn on the emotional switch so that I could actually connect with atmospheres and women better. I know how to turn it on now but it definitely isn't automatic. Maybe that was a pipe dream. What reason would I have to talk to her? Why would I call someone that I haven't seen in 4 months and have not plans on seeing for more. I haven't received a text back so that is also a prompter of this post. It just feels like I get random spurts of the needy emotion, that nerdy disgusting old faggot Chi rears his head and says or does something that isn't okay in the real world, and current Chi has to deal with it. Why can't I just be cool man Chi all the time? Haha I guess if that was the case then life would be easy. I really just want someone to tell me what to do all the time so that I have someone else's neck to hang the blame around. That's it. I am constantly looking for a way to avoid that direct hand's on rejection. I hate that shit. I know I am supposed to love it but I hate it. I used to love it in Baltimore and that was why I was a fucking Cassanova in summer '15. I'm always thinking thinking thinking. Is there a way to escape the automaticity of life? How can I take a further step into being more comfortable with who I am? I still get these hot flashes of emotion that force irrational action (nigga moments). I don't like nor do I want those. The only way is to just not have them I need to become more masterful of my emotions though I feel like that may fly in the face of 'not giving a fuck' and make me even more logical and try hard making the whole attempt to have control a logical exercise putting me further in my head and--- stop. just stop.Think of it like this Chi. This is Westworld. You have the ability to program your traits. You have the ability to write your own story. This is simple Whenever you come to a crossroad like 'to call or not to call' take a step back and look at your character and wonder,""Is this who I want to be? What advice would I give another man in my shoes?"" Whatever the answer is to those two questions, that is what you should do."
clay wants to own the romper business - no,2023-10-13 16:55:00,"my friend approached me with soome weird deal where he gets to own me and will pay me to do things. my answer is nope. now i tried to talk him down out of it but it ended up rambling. the feeling came up though. ""oh shit is this guy trying to buy me out""I wasn't blunt thoughnow- under no circumstance must you do business with this man. you can order him a romper in the new setup. he can help make content if he wants but that's all. everything is limited and it has to be. that's an absolute wile impulse to go for total control of an organization, brand or a person. at 100k maybe. but actually no. the whole reason I'm doing this if for shenanigans and for the streets. I can't and won't sell out.die once but live everyday"
,2016-10-17 13:23:00,"One of my friends just died. I don't know how. But he is gone. I did not cry. I reminisced. I remember the moments that I spent with him in my last year of partying. I reminisce about how I made his final year(s) that best of his life and how he contributed to mine. I remember how nice he was and how happy and cool the man was every time I saw him. I have no negative memories of him. His name was Sean. Life is short. This brings this shit back into perspective for me. You never know when everything is going to be snuffed out and ended. That is the reason that am going to france at the end of the year for three weeks. It will be hard because I will have to try harder than every to learn a new language and be able to speak it by then. I will learn french in two months. Bet. Going through 2 hours of lessons per day. speaking only French for those hours and writing even these blog posts in french will be what I am doing till then to assist in this goal. We will see. But foreal, this event has made me far more real as far as my decisions go. I am still in debt but I will pay it back sometime, probably once I'm graduated. What I can't pay back once I'm graduated is the experiences of different cultures and places. This is feeling like it might be an excuse to be increasingly irrational with my decision. But whatever. I will actually make a solid effort in planning this one . No new hoes. I am excellent though. I distinctly have the ability to create situations where I can meet new individuals and go on instant dates. I can do anything that I put my mind to. It is all about action. Massive massive action. Overwhelm my brain with action. TSA KTN - TT11G59XS"
hahaha women in the workplace + Carly,2016-09-14 14:17:00,"This is a generalization. If I ever run for public office or do something evil or die, someone will one day find this. Hello to you and welcome. This is where I come to relieve myself of thoughts that have no place being expressed in the real world. This is the last bastion of male solitude. my safe space if you will. I have no delusions of grandeur that I will become famous from my bullshit writing. Otherwise I would make this thing more public and advertise what I am posting. This is just for me. This is for me and the future me who likes reflecting on my past low points. It is pretty much the case that I only really come here when I am confused with life and don't know where to go. It usually has to do with women. Any way on to the title of the post: women in the workplace. I was just in a meeting where there was a small argument about how information should be disseminated to the manufacturing floor. To set the scene for the future me, there were about 30 people in the room with 5 or so contributing to the conversation. Voices were slightly raised and it felt slightly antagonistic at a couple points. The men argued like men. Good points or not so good points back and forth with an understanding at the end. I should correct that last sentence and say this is how reasonable rational (usually white) men argue. Black men are on the aggregate more unreasonable. But reasonable rational black men would argue this way as well. This almost doesn't deserve a caveat. but fuck you these are the thoughts in my head. Then one of the women in the room spoke up. She had a couple back and forths with the main guy who had initiated the discussion before she was spanked. haha not really. that didn't happen. But what happened was she said something that she thought was so reasonable that it was impossible to disagree with. She was wrong. The Original man said something like, ""I actually do disagree. It is specifically defined in the employee handbook and everyday when we do our walks that this is an expectation of the program leader."" She said somehting like, ""well we need something down on paper because we are there every day"" and he said, ""ah no you're not, because your boards where some of the ones that haven't been updated in 5 days, but that's a conversation for another time"". He said it in a short terse tone. She shut down. I saw her arms fold up. She looked away. Her nose got red. She started wiping her eyes every minute or so. It is a bit amusing to see white women try to hide their feelings. Evolutionarily speaking, turning red as a result of the environment probably helped signal that there is something wrong i.e. the person in question's body is too cold or they are in some sort of danger. I just made that up. Today, it is definitely a weakness. Anyway, this woman was about to cry. She's probably in the bathroom right now. Meanwhile the men continued to have the same conversation and came to an amicable agreement about what was expected. I fully believe that we could all grab a beer and enjoy each other's company after that. Us. By we I mean the men. The woman was destroyed and really could not rally to rejoin the conversation on account of her feelings. In the future this is all going to crash down on us, When women like this dominate the workforce (it's coming, they already dominate higher learning), the world will end. I don't know how society will thrive when these inferior humans are constantly derailing conversations and businesses with their emotions. Not that that is what happened here. But it would have happened if it had been mostly women in the room instead of men. This shit is coming. and when it does, be afraid. Be very afraid. Literally, you probably just shouldn't speak in the workplace.Engineering is the last male space and slowly we are losing that as well. When all is lost and done, I will have you. and by you I mean me. Chi. Still becoming a person. Also, this is not all women. This is just most. and I say that with only personal anecdote. I have met several powerful women that would handle their emotions and be just as effectual in that meeting as the men were. It is just also the case that most of the women I've met would have behaved even worse than this childish child woman. Maybe I'm wrong. Idk. I hope I am. I hope most women aren't like that one. whatever. also my roommate girl is awesome. I think I am going to try to fake date her. Fake dating someone is where you do all the same things that you would do if you were dating except kissing and sex. So similar to a normal friendship but with a Mt. Everest of sexual tension. I like that haha. Sounds like a funny joke that I can make in the future. Here name is Carly. And her last name is german. Holtfansen or something. i could just look in my phone for it but I don't care that much. I did find out one thing though. Yay for introspection! I insult females that I consider more attractive than me. My hypo is that this tactic is to bring them down to my level in my mind. This is destructive and bullshit but they like it. So I continue. I do need to lessen it though so it is more teasingy (haha I've definitely made up several words in the creation of this blog). Maybe I should start a new blog with reasonable positions. I do like my safe space though."
Hello darkness my old friend.,2017-07-04 11:04:00,"You failed. This feels like the truest rejection I’ve ever received. I dove in and kissed a girl without warning and she really didn’t like it. She didn’t like it to the point where she was almost disgusted by the fact that I had done that.Then, her and her friend got up and walked out. I tried to stop her and she said, ""No, you have to learn a lesson.” And left. I think it may have been one of those things where you still are supposed to chase after the girl but … Oops, I didn’t even think that it was an option. I mean when I get such an honest rebuke, my body shuts down. I want to go into a corner and cry. It is a command to my conscious and subconscious to sit the fuck down. It hurts. Her name is Anna Briggs (@nabriggs instagram). I really liked her for that hour that I knew her. Haha. That is actually hilarious. That that sort of an interaction has affected me so. Doesn’t make logical sense to be upset about this. I will say that there does need to be more reflection before doing anything sexual with women. And I know. I’ve talked this before. If I would have followed my last blog post I would still be good. I would be living in a different world with some additional valuable relationships Instead I continue to suffer through the pain of meeting new girls and destroying the relationship with sexuality and sex. Why? I don’t know. Is there a part of me that doesn’t want me to succeed with a woman? I wonder. Well. On to the next two. The next best is this small cute Rashida Jones beautiful female. She was fun and joyous. I wonder whether I will be able to see her tomorrow. The other girl is another girl that I will be calling in the morning. Good luck Chi. I don’t know how to change you but try to treat these girls with respect. Leave sex at the door. Try to."

choices pt 2 (reminiscent of 2019 lmao),2022-07-18 19:36:00,the question is the freedom of traveling loosely from place to place in eastern Europe or sit down in Russia again and build from the ground
Estonia is lit,2016-12-25 10:22:00,"My first night here my ego was on some shit. I got drunk as shit and almost fought some russian who's girlfriend I had approached. The nigga moment was there and close . I was lucky an old white man was nearby to pull me away from the bullshit. But fuck all that. Day bang is a literal manual to success. I used some of it yesterday to approach a girl on the way home in one of the open big squares in Estonia. It was lit. The girl was so happy that I had started talking to her. It was 100% unnecessary to use any direct game. She was on from the moment I said hello. I should be going on a date with her today. For the second thing, I was at a dance club. I picked up a russian girl on the dance floor. My game was impeccable. I danced and danced, making every girl in the venue jealous as fuck. We kissed and kissed and talked. The only thing was she had her friend with her. When we left, we all left together. They wanted to walk me back to my hostel. So I let them. That was not a great idea maybe. I am trying to maybe piece together why she hasn't responded to my initial message. I think the I was playing up the shit between her and her fiend up too much. I was holding hands with both of them and even when I left, I gave both of them a goodbye that was sensual although only the brunette got a kiss. All in all, I'm a fucking boss. I really do need to nail down some concrete routines so that I can be more consistent. I have some shit that I really do say every time I talk to these girls. I need to formalize it and make it better. A lot of it will still be giving off the right intent and the right vibe but I can get the bullshit talking and jokes out of the way. The jokes maybe I will leave since I am hilarious. Anyway. Roosh V is fantastic and has really created some great work. I hope to do something similarly great one day. He is an immortal with game. I would pay to go out with him and see him in action. I did not decide whether or not I will be staying the extra two days..... pause..... I really want to send a follow-up text to the russian. I want to send ""Oui"". That was the ongoing joke that we had during our conversations last night. It was annoying that I kept using the french word for yes and we kept play fighting over it. It made the interaction double fun. I really did enjoy her company. I really want to send that text. There is nothing to lose from it but the principle says that I should not. I t will be needy and it will decrease the amount of game in the universe overall. But then again, a man is a man who goes for what he wants. If that means sending one more fucking text to make sure something is dead, then so be it. But at the same time, whatsapp has fucking read receipts and the text I sent had a question. There is no reason to send anything since she is really not will going to put in the effort to respond to a question. It's not even that Chi, This is a question of integrity. Do you think that you are worth more that this? I think the compromise is sending a funny GIF? No. no nonononononon. There are too many girls on the earth. never forget that shit. This has been me trying to talk myself out of sending a second message. Every time I open the page I see those two blue check marks and the time stamp on them and I think Jesus. This would be pure evil. You are a boss. I don't need to tell you that lowering yourself to this place will only make you feel worse and since she 99.999% won't respond, you might feel better in this moment but in a few hours you will thing, ""Damn, I am a pussy."" Don't be that guy that you hate. You are allowed to check whatsapp a few more times just to make sure the massages refresh but on the real you are not allowed to click on her contact from this point. I have to put my foot down my good sir to prevent you from hurting yourself. You are a baller. Act like it. bye"
what would i do if money was illegal,2023-10-13 16:58:00,"i'd have hella rompers. I'd have stock of them and I'd just go different places selling them and possibly teaching social skills along the way.that said, i have some basal anxiety about being successful if i go back out into that world. but the question is - well i mea ni tried to an extent and literally hated existence and wanted to killmyself but didn't have the energy or desire to even do that. just wanted to not exist. now is it possible to still do social media and design rompers and love life and do it infinitely. I have no idea. happiness is a wierd thing. i think i am happy just thinking bout the potential of all of the shit. I am happy and miserable. I want to kill myself but the idea that I could not want to kill myself one day makes me excited to keep going. really stupid that I am sitting here wasting away when i could trivially be making stupid money if i just call a few people. like what the actual fuck. ----\oct 13. if money were no object is something like a trick question... all the incentives in life change. what does happiness or fulfilment mean in the absence of money? thing almost necessarily have value even if it's the time value of what the entity that made it put in. that said, on a cosmic scale, nothing has value probably. so the answer is something like love. help people. make things. interact with other humans."
i guess i shouldn't be looking at jobs in russia anymore?,2022-10-31 15:36:00,"i feel like the move isn't the move anymore. after i've been divorced from the reality of not being able to go to russia for work early next year, my energy hasn't been the same. I'm struggling in general as always - what can i say. the prospect of convincing onself or simply understanding for one's self that life is worth living is one of the most daunting tasks i've ever taken up as a person. I reach it all the time but it's truly a daily struggle and might even be something I work on my whole life. dauntingcool though. some notes in general- it's been nigh on impossible to work with knitted fabrics and highly stretchy material. my second foray into the subject matter has ended in abject failure - the first fabric that I ever purchased was attempted to be molded and it was just massively oversized... which is obvious in hindsight. you can't / shouldn't be using >50% spandex blends for normal clothing. it's great drape but the level of control you have to have over the fabric is immense. I'm calling it on that one. I will try to sew some tshirts for christ with all that knit that I have of the OG pattern but fuck knits other than that.which brings me back to phil.

dad,2021-05-03 08:12:00,"I am in a negative headspace. Ras flip on my dad That said, I am uninterested in having a relationship with him in the future. Our relationship does not produce any value from an emotional standpoint or any other standpoint that I can think of. If he was a friend who had said that to me, I would stop talking to that person because truly, this person does not know anything about me. He told me that I came back to Russia with nothing. And I tried to force him to clarify because he was on dangerous waters. And I tried explaining, no, that ‘trip’ was worth more to me than money and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. And still You came back with nothing I still have the raw feeling from being with Mary. I still have the ras focused on all of the most wonderful things of that relationship. And I remember the feeling that I felt when she was telling me that she loved me for the first ant last time. That was the only girl in my life to look at me in the eyes and say that. Well over the phone in the eyes. And to tell me three or four times that that was nothing is the most disrespectful hurtful thing that you could ever say to someone. And I made a point to say, bro, you do not know me. You can’t say that shit because you don’t know me ant the fact that that thought even appeared in your head just makes this whole thing a laughing matter. Family is real but not if family doesn’t act like family. This man isn’t my father. This guy has always been a demon of negativity that has haunted me to this very day. I’m not sure if I’ll speak to him again. If so, it will be cordial. Sir, you don’t know me and unfortunately, you will probably never get the chance to know me, kelechi, or chinwe, your first three children because of your beliefs and the dense way that you interreact with life. I don’t know everything but I know some things. You definitely don’t know everything. You missed your first daughter’s wedding. You don’t know anything about your first born son other than the superficial shit. How are his relationships? What are his dreams and goals? What does he do for fun in his free time? How are your daughters’ relationships with boys? Do they go to parties? And I’m under no pretense that parents should know everything about their children but goddamn they should at lease be friendly. Deadass I’m not friends with my dad. I am kinda friends with my mom. We talk from time to time and help each other out with things. There’s literally nothing ever in the history of anything that I would pick up the phone and call my dad for. Literally nothing. So if you want to know why we’ve never had a relationship it is because he has always been going for his dreams and failing while we survive on money from the government. And even now my mother supports the house and is the main money maker. No shade if that’s how you want to do it but dam, if we’re going ot get into a dick measuring contest lets do it. You have a registered US business. Does it make a profit. Let me see the 2020 tax forms. Let me see the P&L for March. For fucks sake, why am I still writing this. Truly no one on this earth brings this type of energy out of me. This nigga. I’m out. At least I only have a few days left. later"
31 - Madeleine Doggett (I understand being a hoe///NUANCE),2017-07-12 16:10:00,"I now understand what some girls feel when I ask them out on a date. There is an initial liking that comes from looks and personality but there is often a hard ending to that liking... a hard ending at sexual activity. The girl above asked me out on a ""real date"" yesterday. Immediately, I went dishonest. If this girl knew anything about body language, she would have dipped. Unfortunately for her, she couldn't. This was an interesting situation where I genuinely tried to have fun and enjoy the pre-sex moments more since those are the ones that I really like. Another sex another day. I don't care about sex. It's boring to me. I need to find a way to spice it up. I had no effect on this girl, neither through my dick or fingers. This is somewhat of an issue. I would like to be better at sex. The next step here is to figure out some new routines for pre-sex and sex. Anyway, back the reason for this paper. I understand now what girls think when they like me but aren't ready to go out on a date. To some extent, it really is a situation where they like me but they aren't willing to commit to anything. Girls are the new fuckboys. Roles switched sometime and now women are the ones acting like pump and dumpers. Except, roles really haven't switched. It's just that now girls are also engaged in the fuckbboy behavior. Everyone is one the fuck me and dip and don't ask personal questions type shit. Am I fine with this? Yes, to some extent. It means that I can continue to ratchet my numbers up with wild abandon. It means that I can progressively increase the quality (attractiveness-wise) of girl that I am fucking. On another level though, I do want to chill. I want to feel that feeling that people in relationships have when they look at their partner and think, ""I don't want to have sex with anyone else."" There is a peace there that I can imagine. Freedom from the rat race. Freedom from the game. After all, we playing this thing to win. This girl isn't someone who I'd like to get to know. I feel that I already know all that I would like to know. It's amazing the cloud that is removed from one's vision the moment that sex has been gotten and is out of the way. Truly, I don't care for or like this person and I am here for reasons that have been fulfilled. A relationship isn't this golden mule that I should be trying to obtain at all cost. There is value in it only if it is with a person that actually matters to me on some level. I'll be a hoe until I find a woman that I actually like... seems like a life journey all in itself m8. Good Luck. Random aside---- Marriage is such a shitty thing and it just seems like the wrong decision for men all the way around. Any way you couch it, the risk is massive and the upside is almost negligible. In fact, I don't even know if there is an upside. Random Aside 2------ Bruh I'm playing three females right now. 13-year-old Rashida Jones, Maddy, and the 33-year-old with three female kids (Tanya). You a boss my nigga. You have reached a point of mastery and confidence in this city that will be hard to lose. Be very careful with that ego though mate. YOU know how crazy out of control that boy can get. Relevant Aside 1------ I didn't even try to get laid by this girl. Haha in fact, she notified me earlier in the night that I wasn't going home with her. I just looked at her face. There was no response from me. I had no intention of sleeping with her that night anyhow. Quick flip at the end of the staring contest, ""Wait, did you think I was trying to have sex with you?"" Shut that bullshit right down. A few minutes of passionate kissing with no conversation in between (I actually genuinely enjoyed that... reminded me of Brittany from Canada) and she asked me to come back. The condoms that I used were phenomenal. It's good that I have been wacking it all week or I would have come way sooner. And the second I see that nothing is happening on her face, I cum as quickly as possible. Lastly, I had a pool of a cum-like substance on my pubic area that appeared some time during my smashin. It wasn't my cum since All of my shit was in the condom wrapper. Mysteries of the deep. I need to get checked for disease soon."
"Field report - Adderall, leggings, and a romper",2019-09-08 09:05:00,"This was not an eventful night. I gotta say I was feeling pretty good after my dancing in the gym and my workout. I was feeling strong and confident. But as we know, feeling that in the moment at the gym and translating that into action are two completely different stories. I always really really want to carry over the momentum but some atmospheres just kill me. That is kinda what happened tonight combined with a couple other factors. I was on the fence about actually going out but I really wanted to see what it would be like on Adderall while having on a romper and leggings. Interesting idea. I definitely want to conduct similar experiences like this. Quick aside, I came to a conclusion about my personality. I am equal parts extroverted and introverted. In fact, I think it is a simple default to be introverted. Over the past 7 years or so, I have trained that part of myself to be the best that it can be, but goddamn, the other side of me still exists and wants to be settled out and comfortable. The compromise is this: I think that each day I should be doing at least one extroverted thing... whether that is trying to sing in a park to random people, dancing with other humans, or doing game, I should be forced to do one thing every day to water that garden that part of my identity and soul resides in. That said, I tried today. I approached the first girl that I saw when I got out of my car. Her name was Camille and she was from France. That set hooked amazingly and we ended up talking for about 30 minutes. I found out that she was going home early and that she had been out with friends since 5pm. I asked if she was someone important. That seems to be a current tick of mine. It had a good effect on her and since I was feeling crazy extroversion, that question definitely prompted her to think that I was possibly someone important. We went back and forth about careers and I tried to guess hers. She is a postdoc in biology working at the NIH in Bethesda. I definitely sprinted in a lot of premise by calling her cute and other slight compliments like that. It worked well on her since I could tell she definitely did not interact with dudes a ton. I likely have a solid coffee date planned sometime next week. But the night didn’t go much further from there. I walked up the street, doing a couple high fives, but not nearly enough interactions to sustain my vibe or mood, which quickly went to zero. I was self conscious about my outfit. I hadn’t worn leggings in awhile and I knew that peoples’ reactions would be high. I didn’t want that so I ended up not doing any approaches. I did go into Grand Central finally. I did a line approach of the 2 guys behind me by asking if this was the best place to go. They said yes. I could have easily approached the girls in front of me. When I got into the place, there were sets everywhere. Solid dance floor sets that were clearly waiting for someone fun to come down those stairs. Unfortunately that person was long gone. I stood near the bar for about 15 minutes. There was a short interaction with the group on my left when the girl started dancing while waiting on her drink. Other than that, I was deadpan. I couldn’t move or talk or do anything... not because it was crowded but because I was scared of people’s reactions. I knew rejection was more likely in this area since the girls were younger and wearing that outfit heightened my sense of fear. I walked across the club and went toward the bathrooms. There was a guy dancing up on a wall over there. I approached and made a joke about him grinding up on the wall. Him and his friends laughed. I then went near the bar. There was a small cute asian girl that was very interested in me... the initiated the approach a bit by giving eye contact and dancing. I, in turn, started dancing with/near her. She then noticed my outfit and exclaimed and asked what was going on. I answered her question with a question about he necklace which looked like a pair of bullhorns... I asked if they were real bullhorns which was of extremely mild hilarity to me. She answered no, it was a crescent moon. I then answered her original question by saying that I was feeling wild tonight. We kinda danced but the reaction was going cold so I teased her about her white pants by saying she must not plan on doing anything dirty tonight. She reacted a lot to that statement but I didn’t do anything with it like I should have. Instead I saw her friend who was not dancing at all and started trying to get her to dance with energy and eye contact. She kept saying she doesn’t dance. I stayed trying for probably another minute as this is something that brings me hilarity. I am amused by that energy difference and the inability for someone to open up and I always want to explore that. Eventually, the original girl I was speaking to grabbed some tall dude nearby and walked a few feet away. I ended the interaction with the girl by saying I wanted more out of her when I came back. I walked to the bar where I saw a dude that was matching shirts with another guy. I commented about it. The guy was visiting from North Carolina where he was a marine. I bullshitted with him for a minute before I did an approach of this woman walking by. I hit her with a who are you and something like you are the first girl I’m talking to in this club. It seemed like she hooked. I took it further by saying yeah I saw her walk by and assumed she was gone forever but when I saw her again I realized I had a second chance. I said something else and started dancing on her front to front. She laughed and basically immediately turned and grabbed some other dude. I’m not sure what the deal was... I think it had to have been a boyfriend or date or something but who knows. From there, I was done. I couldn’t survive. I dipped out, walked to my car, drove to Bethesda, and now I’m writing this now. I had the option to go to Capo to meet up with some dudes and expand my network but I decided I wanted to code and write instead. I don’t now if that was a good decision as this shit can be written at any time of day... but maintaining groups that you meet while out is a difficult job that requires a lot of conscious effort and attention. I may have lost access to a friend group because I was being a bitch tonight. So, I don’t know. Another general plus is that my hinge profile has been getting a bit of love lately. I like this. I have been able to get 3 numbers and 2 meetups after starting utilizing the methods of Chasing Fire. I like this success and expect to continue to see such success as a refine my openers. As for going out, Chi, you need to do a better job. The world needs your energy. We talk all the time about being shameless. Part of the message behind wearing these clothes is the shamelessness of it all. The complete lack of care for social norms while being as fun as possible. I expect more from you brother. Do better in the future. Remember, as far as all this goes, I’d like you to think about doing game everyday. This will be interesting. I say do it for the sake of doing it, not for the sex and the women. You need extroversion in your life. You also need to get more comfortable talking to pretty girls. You are very very comfortable talking with guys. You sometimes talk to more guys in a night than women. What would happen if you reversed that? That is a new exciting, interesting goal"
Mary in Kazan - what do i feel,2021-05-06 14:42:00,"I woke up to mary posting some stories of her trip to kazan with another boy who speaks english. i am strill struggling with how i feel about her. it's truly such a strange feeling. like I don't want to be with her. I truly did want her to find a guy that loved her that would give her the freedom to be open and loved. I didn't think and don't think that I feel the way that I need to or even am in the general life place where I could support her. that said, I feel something in me. I am feeling it out but truly I don't really know hat it is. It feels like a tug on my heart. It's kinda a good feeling. I find myself smiling instead of crying. I feel the impulse to feel good rather than something else. I'm not reminiscing as much. I'm not jealous. You know, it feels a lot like when one of your boys find a girl in a night and you didn't. Like you winged him, you set up the first kiss, you put them on the way to the taxi, and you are happy for him and happy that you were able to make the world a better place for a little bit for the participants of the activities that were partaken in. all that is true and should be said. At the same time, when you are looking at the club, whether you walk back in or you stayed as your friend left, you see a radically different place. It's a little colder. It's a little more brash, and abrupt. The rounded edges and comfort that you build up with your friend had his girl are gone and you're left in a place that isn't immediately welcoming and open.Immediately, nothing is forthcoming. You can see some of the girls and guys that you had been interacting with that night cavorting and having a grand old time and you are on the outside. That feeling is what I feel now. It's a happiness, mixed with a melancholy sadness at the fact if I want the same thing as him or if I want a 'better' night I have to do something. It's an understanding that though I loved helping someone else all night, I am here now alone and I can't live through his love and his experiences (or her).It's on me to improve my life. It's on me to have fun. It's on me to move on. In that moment, you have that choice. Go home or shrug it off and head back into the fray. I'm sure Mary had that moment while watching the videos of me dancing on snap. I'm sure she felt that I moved of or that I had other girls already. And she was sad and decided to get busy living. Jump back in the pool. I've enjoyed this time alone. I think this time of reflection has led me to a deeper understanding of what life can be and has given me some tools on how to deal with it in the future. I am loathe to remove myself from even this however bitter and melancholy and fickle this comfort zone is. It's such a shitty comfort zone haha. but it's still comfortable. Walking up to someone new isn't comfortable. Filming yourself dancing in public isn't comfortable. Moving to a new city and starting to go on new dates isn't comfortable. Of course, ultimately, it's my choice. It's on me to move forward or to stay staring out through my IG glasses admiring how others are living their lives through apathy, nihilism, melancholy, and nostalgia. The memories will always be there. The present moment will not. It's time to go."
Alcohol,2016-11-19 06:10:00,I'm have had a lot to drink. Way more than my limit. I made a couple guy friends so that's lit. But I'm coming off creepy to girls. I'm not.a real person right now. I am alcohol Tom. Nigga Tom.
here again,2022-06-09 19:32:00,"I'm not moving the needle anymore. I've fully died in a real way and I'm trying to revive what's left in order to get to the other side. Content doesn't help. It gives me some level of ideas into the content to create next but I'd be lying if it wasn't just a rip of what I saw the other person do.I am a leech on this world and I don't feel like doing that anymore. I'm tired of not giving but I just don't see how to really continue. I want to quit so fucking bad. Everyday is a chore. reliving the same day, the same thoughts, the same hatred of everything I am and stand for. Why can't i create. why am i sitting here feeling bad instead of actually doing somethign to change my position. I just don't care. I just don't care. There's the paradox of action though where if I start to do something it makes sense again. I see the hope I see the potential. Inevitably though I have to stop diong X and the reality of whatever sets in. I don't have money to buy food. I don't have enough money to even leave LA. I could end up as one of these homeless at any minute. I hate everything I've become. I hate that I can't live outside of others. I hate that these kids are successful and I'm an old man barely able to feed himself. Yes their videos are better than mine. so there's nothing to do or say about it. just suicide. a whole bottle of pills. of course as research has shown, that probably would be a prolonged way to go... liver failure in 2 days ain't it. My preferred way would be a flight away from evreythign without telling anyone and just existing. no phone no computer no social media. I'd just die in every way that is possible and then maybe actually as well."
why,2022-09-21 05:00:00,"last weekend i went to scottsdale. it was fun but underwhelming. nothing lives up to that original high and that original takeover that I felt back in february when I came. I have been chasing that feeling. Everything made sense. I was on a path towards social media success - everything I touched was gold and it felt like I was in a new life. I haven’t felt that feeling in a while. Like a belonged. Like I was supposed to be doing the thing that I’m doing in the moment. Everyday feels like either a retreading of a past move or a treadmill step in purgatory and I don’t know how to escape. I do things and act out my character. Simon.Blonde charismatic sexless depressed machine. I have no business giving others advice when I myself am such a damn wreck. I guess one thing hasn’t changed - in the bad moments, I want to kill myself and in the okay moments, I either feel nothing or I relax into the meaningless of watching another youtube video with another bag of candy. There’s a worthless entertainment value to that that I enjoy. I feel like I’m participating passively in something… something that has no worth or value in our capitalist society but participating nevertheless. Mobilizing all of my muscles to continue perpetuating my existence is exhausting by definition but it’s always felt tiring on a different level. I’m tired of not having anything that I care about enough to truly work for / towards. I find it mildly funny where I’m at now. Last weekend, a girl came over to Jay’s crib. She was beautiful but more importantly she was fun and silly. She was surprising at every turn and legitimately a joy to be around. In that situation, nothing in my body was motivated towards chasing or pursuing her. Which is weird to me because why wouldn’t I be attracted to a beautiful girl with a personality. I worked through it in a conversation witha a guy who later got her number - there was no context in my mind to where I thought that I could add anything to that girl. I don’t view myself as anything of value even from a sexual standpoint and that’s lead to an almost total castractoin in my person. I still participate in the charades required of going out in the current era but there’s nothing behind the mask. Domesticated lion energy. Nonpoisonous snake energy. That’s coming from my last relationship where my self esteem started to and finished falling apart during that open relationship. I built back better but the whole TikTok debacle has placed me squarely back in the place that I was before.I just took a small break to review the online information about me - it’s fucked . There are just too many articles. I’ll have to legitimately get my name changed if I want to get back into the industry.So what the fuck now. i don’t know but that’s really not a sufficient answer. I feel a ting of drastic. I need to do some drugs and figure this out or just get off the pot. I don’t see how this can all work out or how I can get back to a normal place. I still love my fuck off to Siberia idea though I’m moderately worried about the future. People won’t miss me too much though. Lord knows the months go by and people move on. I want to feel like what I do matters but I don’t know if that’s a reasonable expectation for my own mind anymore. If my flame goes out, I’ll at least go to the last place where I felt like I belonged."
PUA Critique by Leo,2017-08-10 17:26:00,"Partially Finished ... I’m not just chasing vagina. You could reduce it to that but that sentence is more a reflection of you than anything. To bring people to the next stages in life, we are doing god's work by bringing people out of stage blue. No one is saying that being nice is stupid. It is being nice and doing favors dishonestly toward an unstated goal that is lame and stupid. Claim: Pickup is selfish and anti-spiritual – not necessarily. Yes we are coming from a place of emotional pain. This is correct. This is simplistic thinking. Yes I am emotionally wounded. Pickup has given me a new key, a new way to interact with the world. It has given me friends, jobs, money, and experiences to die for. When I see someone else who is living at that lower state, struggling to talk to or pickup women AND actively complains that nice guys don’t get the time of day, something pings inside me. I want this man to experience all that life has to offer. I want this man to be able to travel to Estonia, DC, or LA and be able to have a genuine good time without having to drugs and drink himself to death. At this point, I get more pleasure from putting some other guy on to this lifestyle and the Apex is when I have created a new best friend who shares similarly awesome experiences with me. I’ve created someone who isn’t cowering in their comfort zone. When you reduce this shit to, the other person isn’t damaged so that’s why they won’t do pickup, it’s bullshit. The reason someone won’t do pickup is the stifling all-encompassing fear of the unknown. What do I say, how do I get her to like me, what do I do, etc. You hear the same shit over and over and over. They are weak and their weakness prevents them from being great. Claim: You don’t care about the people around you. This isn't true to the extent that you wish it was. I do care about myself and my own agenda more than anyone else or their agenda. And so does everyone else on the planet. That is the default and only choice. Your agenda is your actions. I'll tell you who I do care about though. I care about the men and women that I call friends that I brought to this space. I care about that lonely lame guy who just needs an introduction or pump-up to change the rest of his night and, maybe, the rest of his life. I care about the bored girl who is looking for someone to come in and make her night/life worth her leaving her bed that morning. I care about the woman who is out looking for someone to meet her on an intellectual and physical level. I especially care about that girl on the dance floor that can finally say she has met her match with me. So fuck that. Also, this theory of value systems is bullshit. I will not become more of a communist as I grow older. The terms greedy and exploitative mean nothing to me because 99% of the time the terms are so frivolously bandied about, they shouldn’t have meaning to anyone. I’ll never be a Green. I don’t have any ‘pickup’ friends and the friends I have made are all awesome. Transcendence of the ego. There is no Ego. This apparently is spiritual. – hit this Disrespectful to women – apparently causes collateral damage. Emotional damage created by convincing a girl to sleep with you, cheating on a girl, undermining a girl’s relationship, treat a girlfriend how you’ve learned in pickup. Claim: You don’t care about her. – This is true to some extent. This is the mentality you have to have in life though. Literally, everywhere in life, if you approach life like oops I refuse to break anyone else’s agenda. You will not excel in business, life, or love. You shouldn’t be necessarily not caring about anyone else and only caring about your own wishes BUT what is missing is that you have to have respect for yourself and what you want in the world. Claim: Pickup builds up wrong stereotypes of women. The stereotypes are that we refer to them derogatorily? You just named a whole bunch of words that are used to refer to women, none of which have explicit actions attached to them. There are truths about women that are true whether you like it or not and to ignore human or female nature is your folly. Hypergamy is real. Women stealing during divorces Is like pickup, apparently. That is a false analogy. This shows your lack of knowledge of women and you are perpetuating the stereotype that women don’t like, want, or enjoy sex. In my experience, it is literally impossible to get a relationship with a girl under that age of 24. You have to fuck her at least 10 times and maybe, MAYBE afterward she will become interested in something more. Most women want and enjoy random promiscuous sex with attractive unknowns. Women want and need the pickup community, whether they know it or not. How often do you hear women complain about the lack of good men, manly men, men with balls, men who go out and get what they want, men with ambitions and grit. This is at the very least a stage of development that every man has to go through to get to that place. He has to experience success, failure, love, hope, sadness, anger hundreds of times in a week or year. He will become more solid in who he is and what he believes. Eventually, he will start to draw up boundaries and think for himself. Eventually, the skills he learns in the streets will help him ace that interview and be making 6 figures in a corporate job. Eventually, he will be driven to learn new hobbies and skills to better himself and add to his level of attractiveness to himself and to the world. Eventually, he will like the guy who is looking back at him in the mirror. This contrived scenario about thousands of women conniving to marry and divorce rich men is the opposite of this. It’s sole purpose if the destruction of the target. It inherently requires deceit, manipulation, and conscious will to put someone else in pain. There is no benevolence about it. There is no way to reinterpret it. There is no man who would consent and like an experience like this. Lol if you are calling being authentic, manipulative, I don’t know what to tell you man."
gabs costa,2016-03-29 16:14:00,"Nothing I say, can or will be taken seriously by the girls that I meet. I ahd a very enlightening conversation with a girl in my bed yesterday. Gabs Costa. And although I don't ever really put much stock into what women say, Gabs did have some interesting insights about me that I have been looking for. She said that she perceives me as an idiot. Around her at least, and that this is in sharp contrast with what I initially come off as. Now, I am in bed with this girl with half of her clothes off so I don't think this 'idiocy' is preventing me from getting laid. But what it is preventing me form in genuine connections with women. I don't mind this because I don't like most women nor do I want any connection beyond the physical. but for the unicorns that do create that want in me, it's difficult to turn off the constant Chi. I'm not sure what i would say or how I would act if I were to let go and be real, in the moment, and in my emotions with a girl. My biggest ear here is that she will just get up and leave or that her opinion of me will change to something different. That her mind will subconsciously morph me into a vagina and I will no longer have that masculine control over myself or her. It's weird and it may not be possible but my goal is to find a way to maintain my masculinity and control over my woman while being completely open and vulnerable at the same time. At it's face, this is contradictory and so that's why moving toward it is difficult. My thought is that if I compromise here and there while diffusing the true emotional connection with Chi, that I can get to this state. But by it's very nature, this is destined to fail since the diffusion of emotional connection is antithetical to being completely open and vulnerable. She suggested moving a lot slower in my courting of girls. I think that there is a grain of salt of truth that I can take from this. Moving slower with more calibrated touching will yield me better results. Also, a priority is to focus on getting good at my seducion techniques. These are seriously lacking and it's really starting to show. I'm not sexy. I'm not doing sexy things or acting in a sexy way. I am still interacting like we are having a conversation and it's lame and kinda weird. Not kinda weird, it is weird. Maybe 20 minutes a day of thinking about how I would take clothes off smoothly and uninterrupted until sexual contact is established is how I'm going to tackle this. Meanwhile the only girl I really like is Vida and she is a Bible-thumping christian who reads he Bible and devotional everyday and goes to baptist church on sundae. She, like most girls, has the opposite belief system as myself. Even so, the need to have sexual relations with her overwhelms me on a daily basis. She is just so perfect in the way she walks, talks, dresses, and smiles. And let's make no mistake... this isn't purely carnal. But if she was ugly, I wouldn't be here so take what you will from that. My game has gotten stale and boring and I'm almost never congruent. Most of the time I go out alone, I feel anxious and alone and when I talk to girls, I am trying to be the opposite of that. It is not working. Anyway, I might have a new singman from the Simple Pickup forum so idk. I know my sticking points. now to fix them. sticking points - being sexy - having sex - being genuine and emotionally available - leading - downtalk - merging how I feel and how I game"
what i hate about my current life (very suicidal),2021-03-07 02:12:00,"1) I live at my parents houseThis helps me save money but it's not worth it. I'm wasting away here. I am not going forward and I simply don't know the path ahead. Everyday, I try to start my engine but I get that sputtering sound... and then nothing. I want to die to escape from all of this shit. I hate this. 2) RelationshipsMary is gone - I mean she's not but she all but is gone. She is a nice girl who understands what she needs to do in order to get what she wants which fluctuates between me and a US citizenship but now is leaning in the direction of that opportunity since I am choosing not to be in a relationship with her. Which is fair enough but fuck now I'm alone. And even if we were still together, I can't keep crying to her with my issues - it's the same problem over and over and she can't do anything to fix my inconsistency and depression. All she can do is ask a couple questions and say something supportive that comes across as forced to me. Jack is with a girl and he's tired of mein general since I push him in dance and eventually he breaks and gives up. I don't have many more friends that I can actually talk to about things and even if I did have those people, they, just like Mary and Jack and even myself, would get tired of hearing the same story told 0 different ways every day and every week. Oh, yes, even I am tired of thinking these thoughts and having these problems. I would love to die and end this shit. It's fucking annoying. Like bro, no one cares figure your shit out and fuck off.3) JobMy job is actually going fine though I'm woefully underutilized as per usual. But it's a symptom of the position. I have to be patient and allow myself to grow into the position that's been given to me. That said, past transgressions give me fear that I'll be able to perform when given the opportunity. I have failed so many people recently that I feel that if I were to fail at this job, that truly would be it for me. This job is really my last chance at a face and name in this world. I'll never apply to another engineering job if I got fired from this one. I many just kill myself if I failed at this one too. 4) AntagonistI'm the villain and antagonist in this movie. I am negative. I am the one who sows seeds of evil thoughts when I'm in my evil moods. I hate myself. h"
Life update - I gotta do this mostly alone,2019-02-11 16:34:00,"It's fascinating the level of effort that people are willing to put into something that they are ostensibly interested in. I look at my 'friends' and whether it's podcasting, going out, responding to messages, designing clothes, designing websites etc. no one is all in. No one is trying I tell my fucking best friend Nate to do a minimal level of promo for the episode that we did together... he doesn't even listen to the podcast. I ask him to go through, pick an interesting clip that he would want to click on after to listen to the full thing, he does none of it. He takes half of the clip that I uploaded onto my story, which takes it out of context mind you, and puts it up on his with no modifications to address his audience. He's trying to start some black future shit and refuses to promote it in any even moderately interesting way. This is what happens when you are in a relationship.. you get complacent and you don't feel like grinding and getting better at things you ostensibly care about. Gabriella, my last and really only female friend mind you, came up with the idea that we start recording our bachelor conversations and upload it to the internet as a podcast. I was like sure that sounds like a fun idea, lets do it! First 2 weeks, struggles to make it at the planned time. second 2 weeks, doesn't do any promo of the thing that she fuckin came up with... like what's the point. Fuck man. I mean I know I'm not doing the absolute most and that the point of this isn't to get famous. I was thinking about it as an extra way fro our friends to engage with us on a show that we love. Who give a fuck if you're makeup isn't on or if you arent' fully dressed up. What the fuck do you think this is. Summarize everything to say this, I don't have to do this alone. That is clear. and you can't do it alone. There are other perspectives that are valuable and give you insight into where to go next. there are so many levels of ideas that wouldn't have come to fruition if not for talking and interacting with other people. But goddamn. This shit is going to be hard with the way that I have been intereacting with people. The friends that I have made by happenstance and proximity are starting to expire. Every relationship has a clock and a lot of these have been run out. I just keep trying to replace the battery in the failing iphone when it is really a hardware problem. Trade it is and get a new version. Good luck my son. There are many ideas that are crazy but could definitely work. One hoe picture, one wholesome picture, a product picture. That will be the aesthetic of the new gram. I can integrate teaching pickup with product salesmanship. Show some pussy dude that is just getting out taking pictures with hot girls all over him then show him being wholesome with just one. I will grind. The background is cool. I believe in you good sir. I will talk to you later."
Hannah almost bang,2021-07-05 01:38:00,I almost had this girl Hannah today. I would give myself a six or seven out of 10 as far as the date went I think that I sufficient I changed locations several times which was nice we had different experiences and then we got to a new place and it was like the third place we started kissing which was nice we kept the progress conversations it was never too logical to nerdy which is good. And even plausible deny ability we ended up at my apartment which was all good it’s the only issue in the end or a couple issues where do you know the size of my apartment you know there’s notThere wasn’t a lot of room to maneuver and to relax so it was all pretty fast the escalation there wasn’t a lot I checked and I wasn’t as hard to gauge in the foreplay more she wanted it she wanted it and she also like didn’t wanna give it up that fast and then you could tell like we were kissing making out like that it was out and everything we’re doing stuff and then I got up a little bit takeoff my shirt and then she got really fast and I pulled a shut down I was like OK I better go before stuff is escalates and I was like calm down like five minutesAnd some shit that I did which was really fucking sweet oh was I had Siri involved I said Siri you know set a timer for three minutes which was good as an idea if I immediately at some point silenced that fucking phone you know because yeah Nigga in three minutes it’s gonna go off and she’s gonna leave and so but it worked like we ask that she even like literally like three minutes you went on my dick slide second and then the alarm went off he got up and was like I got to go and I was like fuck I mean there’s no walks around and there was a little bit of extra shit like went out when we’re in the elevator last time I called her back and I just you know today I really kind of wanted to spend time with somebody and him and she was definitely a physical touch person which is what you know loves the physical touch and it felt really nice to be touched wants to talk really nice to be kind of love the little bit to be treated and I’m comforted at it it was nice I really fucking miss it and you know I think it came out of the ends the slight not desperation but it’s like I mean I enjoyed it I’m enjoying myself it’s just it’s hard if you can’t should I give it feels like with all this game shit like you can’t actually show with the fuck you know you want to be what you wanna do you can actually show we can’t like her too much you can’t give him too much you can’t do all the stuff this is back-and-forth in the suicidal shit I don’t want to be a hoe and this is all the stuff and it’s just like is it about the sex no it’s just like it’s just like lay down with me like sleep with me just relax it doesn’t we don’t need to get anywhere you don’t need to get anywhere just relax she was actually if she was more track of that I thought she was going to be out I was a little bit like but she’s actually pretty attractive you know she’s a German go to Florence casualties got a big old ass cool girl foreign with her own pussy like I would if it was it’s a good fuck if you can get it it’s just she’s 30 some suck a good dick you know if I shut the real dick sucker us but yeah I didn’t the alarm the three minute thing went off and I just I didn’t have the phone in hand I didn’t I had a thought like I need to go in silence were ready but I didn’t and let’s mine the situation ended.Oh no I would say I’m thankful I’m thankful for that opportunity to know Hinge gave me this opportunity to meet this person thanks for the Lord for giving me the wisdom to say the things that I said and even to do the things that I did even though it maybe didn’t end up with you know I guess I can’t have the things that I want for you can’t keep anything you don’t own anything nothing is yours you have to understand that and you know in anything can be the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away as a good book says and it’s true and like you don’t own the things you don’t only thing you think you you you have a temporary hold of everything but if you die tomorrow you don’t want anything in this group could leave you could do anything so but just enjoy the moment that you’re in whatever state you can I think I did enjoy. So in the end I’m thankful and fuck I still have some leftover cantaloupe from her shit so the whole night ahead of me and I still got a club to go to I still got a lot of shit and and I’m excited cited but I’m a little bit rejuvenated just a little bit validated that like finally I think of somebody fucking lie to me after Lisa got laid on his fucking small ass bed in a small apartment actually give me the time a day and I feel like a little bit like me and hold me close and then all that shit like she really grabs she has she’s passionate she like she has some things it’s just you know to get them to be open to those emotions is a whole other things I mean two together to let go of all this shit it’s OK to grab you know but I don’t know it fuck man but I am thankful I’m saying I am thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you I love you my Knigge.
I want to become a man,2017-07-21 14:52:00,"This entails boundaries. This entails standards. This entails saying no to sex sometimes. The latter is something that I have never done. Something that I have never even come close to being done. I'm an addict. I don't even enjoy this shit anymore, yet I continue. \"
lol idk man,2022-01-02 00:39:00,"I heard something from Jordan Peterson today that struck a note in me. He says that the psychological research says that people don’t develop fears but that we are by default afraid of everything and have to unlearn those fears. He said that people get over their fears through exposure to said fear and through that they internalize that while fear may exist and be nontrivial, they themselves are bigger than their fears and can be courageous and brave in the face of things that feel debilitating.I’ve conquered my social fears. I thought that one day. these fears would disappear and I would be one with god. This is not what happened. The fear never went away. The anxiety when I see a pretty girl or get up in front of a crowd is still here. It’s just that now, I can move past it. I understand deeper that my fears and anxieties in these situations are unwarrented and behave as such. In the end though, that anxiety pushes me to improve myself on the front end, specifically with presentations and work, meaning that to accurately make that fear trivial, I should prepare enough to warrant a confidence level worth of such things. I was afraid at the beginning of last night. I wore heels for the first time and I was afraid of the social ostracism that might come as a result of such a behavior. interestingly enough, I don’t think most people noticed and the ones that did thought they were cool. God knows I would be loath to wear these heels in Moscow or Lebanon but again it was interesting to see my fear dissipate and morph into an understanding that nothing had actually changes, only what was on my feet and I could still go on the dance floor and kill it like i always do and girls will like me.I didn’t get laid though. It’s not for not trying but at the same time, I wasn’t trying. I haven’t tried to have sex with someone new in awhile. And I mean something specific when I say try. I mean speak to someone, dance with them, and move around the venue with them with the intent of sleeping with them at the end of the night. I’ve danced and spoken with people, but that instinctive push to take things the extra mile just isn’t there. It makes me a bit sad. Because although bringing girls home and sleeping with them can be empty on the front end, the feelings that you can generate through those interactions on the back end aren’t. I really feel I have a lot to offer a girl and I yearn for a companion. Making these videos alone, going out alone, dancing alone is taking a small toll on me. I’m lonely. there I said it. and I’m lonely and it’s weird to speak to new people knowing that. I just want someone to dance with.I just want someone to dance with.And these days, it feels like that is so much to ask of someone. I don’t know what guys or girls are looking for in their friendships or relationships anymore. Truly, after almost 8 years of running around meeting new people and having fun, it’s an interesting thing to admit. I do think it’s an issue I primarily have in America but it’s an issue all the same because, at minimum, I’m going to live here for 8 more months.It feels like this all might be me making movies, skits, vlogs and travel videos with paid actors and paid video men & women. It’s a dream to have people on this journey with me but this just isn’t meant to be? What if I’m supposed to plan, orchestrate and build this brand and business on the back of professional relationships oiled by my jovial carefree attitude towards life?I can make ‘friends’ along the way in the business. Idk man. idk man lolThere’s also a part of me that thinks I may be slipping… What I mean is that, while I attract people, I am unwilling or unable (no way to tell the difference but probably unable) to close the deal. Felt that way with the last 3-4 women I spoke to in the night. They liked me and wanted to continue but I wasn’t able to setup a context to continue the interactions. On top of those things, I randomly got punched. lol let me explain how this could be related. I didn’t get a good look at the guy and he immediately ran after so I was unable to retaliate or ask him why. On one hand, this could have been an attack based on my race, the fact I was wearing heels, the fact I had long hair and was wearing heels (albeit not in a feminine manner but perhaps all the same), or some combination of those factors. Perhaps someone just didn’t like someone they pictured as crossdressing or not masculine enough and saw an easy target at the end of the night. I think, and one of the girls confirmed though she was kinda drunk so who knows if she was right, that this was one of the guys that had tried and failed to hit on the girls earlier. In his attempt, he tried to make me feel bad for commenting on how one of the girls had a good body. It was miserable for him because the girls sided with me and we all laughed at him and talked shit in Russian. Probably hurt his ego and when he saw us leaving together, got one swipe at me for good measure. Thankful he didn’t stab me or some other bullshit honestly. Hurting men’s egos is probably one of the most dangerous things one can do as a human. If this was the case and this guy hit me because i bruised his ego, did I deserve it? Of course not. that said, could I have treated him differently a…. honestly fuck all this haha. fuck that guy. I mean somehow I could’ve stopped and explained to him that I knew the girls and that I had their consent to speak about them and touch them. I could’ve apologized to him and said, “hey man, I didn’t mean to say something to someone else that offended you, I’m sorry” or something but fuck that. I feel like I got caught slipping (because i did) not only because I was wearing heels and wasn’t prepared for such a situation, but also because I wasn’t present and aware of my surroundings enough to see that there was danger brewing in my vicinity.anyway, I’m tired of writing. We are truly off to a wild start to 2022. I can’t wait to see what happens in my 28th year of life."

diversity and inclusion meeting,2016-07-04 17:58:00,"The distinct lack of critical thinking and doublethink in this group is fucked. There is a strong aversion to any opinion that is different than their own. There are a couple related questions that came up that are the reason for my strong response. Namely: Are you comfortable working with: Someone who is a member of a hate group? Someone who thinks that women should stay at home and take care of kids? I stated that for both of these if these beliefs did not impact the worker's productivity or ability to interact with their coworkers. If you have to have a personal relationship with someone to find out that they are part of one of these groups then I would be completely comfortable with working with that person. The group was not okay with the hate group but was okay using my logic for the conservative. stupid and ridiculous. It's amazing that some people really don'e see the contradictions in their thinking. The second thing is I believe that you should go directly to the individual and talk to them before you pursue corrective action. It pisses me off when people passive aggressively talk behind my back to the higher ups and impact my positioning at the company. If you have a problem with someone, talk to them. Man up, stop being a pussy, stop being not-a-leader. Talk to them and voice your concerns. If the behavior continues, you can then pursue corrective action. If you go over someone's head, it is bad for everyone because now all parties feel slighted and everyone is living in a hostile work environment. I really hate passive aggressivism and how it has permeated our culture. It works hand in hand with the victim mentality that many women and blacks exhibit. These people feel that they are victims but are also too cowardly to confront and talk to a person that they feel slighted by. Worthless. Also, libertarian groups are now labeled by certain groups as hate groups so I guess that I am now not free to be a part of them anymore if I want to maintain employment at any company. So that's now real."
still unhappy,2021-06-20 06:58:00,"Truly just an unhappy person. I don't have any zest for life. I don't want to do things. I just don't. I don't care really to be good at anything, I don't really want more girls, I don't want to be sexier, I don't want to have more money. I just don't. I don't want anything. I just want to be in my apartment doing nothing or very little. I would love to do all of this with a girl or with Mary but truly even this 'want' is something I don't really want because another part of me resents the fact that I don't want the things that I spoke about at the beginning of this paragraph. It's a war where Chibuzor the nerd wins enough to present like the body wants a relationship and wants a more chill docile life of food, family and money while Chi the animal fun cunt wins enough to destroy the relationships and goals that Chibuzor has because he just wants to hang out with friends or something. Chi Level 2 who actually takes chances, lives in abundance, and operates out of a flow state loses most days and only comes out so that both other personalities can understand that what they want can be fully realized if they get Chi Level 2 on their side -> unfortunately for each of them, neither of them win enough to keep keep their Chi so in the end everyone is unhappy and I'd like to swallow a bottle of pills.I think this is the most accurate I've gotten this breakdown. I always think... Just decide on what you want. And then I laugh at that since I don't want anything. I just want to be okay with friends and money. I just want life not to feel like such a chore. I want things to flow. I know it's possible but I don't know If I have the mental to get to that place. I will start using my caffeine pills again. Maybe we can have more fun with the dancing this way."
What I'm thinking + paths forward - CONQUER THE BUNNIER,2017-07-18 21:06:00,"It's approaching the end of my internship. I believe that I am halfway through and I have about 5 or so weeks left. I have my first full-time job interview next week and I haven't prepared much for it. I have no hoes. I read a beautifully written article yesterday on the return of kings that talked about nature of relationships. The premise was women don't want to date men that want girlfriends. It is a weird paradox that I've been dancing on for the past few months trying to pin down. You have to generate attraction first and then the girl is supposed to initiate the relationship. I've gotten a peek at that side over the past month or so since I am able to generate a massive amount of attraction just from dancing and having my face at Red Square, the club that I currently work at. I create the massive amount of attraction that the girls are trying to initiate further with me. A better example is that I met the one curly haired girl out twice and before I had sex with her that night she asked me if I would go on a real date with her. This happened after a serious amount of attraction was generated one way. A couple issues that I have had and am having. I know that they have been documented but I feel like putting it on paper again. Maintaining my own attraction with the girl after sex is the biggest issue. I don't like the girls that I am having sex with. I am interested in them up until I put my penis in and cum. Then, I couldn't give a single fuck about whether they lived or died in the moment after. Part of that is that I generally ignore incompatible shit until I get what I want and I dip. And what I want right now is numbers .Let's be perfectly honest here and let me say that I am in the game for numbers and records. I want to increase the quality and quantity of women as I age. That shows my progression and it is a decent general key performance indicator (KPI). On another level though, I am getting worse at sex because now, since I am not excited nor do I care about the girl I am not as enthusiastic. I don't try as hard. I don't focus. I am just trying to get the cum to rise up out of where it is hiding and then hold it in place until I am finished which is usually just 5-10 minutes, and dip. The most common one is that the girl is a liberal or hates Donald Trump without nuance. I am not a huge fan of the man myself but he is not the Hitler that the media and the left are claiming him to be. Anyone that shows their leftist undergarments to me at any level during the interaction gains my disdain and my condescending feelings. I don't respect you, you don't matter, and you are only worth your pussy. I already know what reasonable Chi is going to say. 'Stop having sex with people you don't like. Stop having sex with liberals. Live by the values that you would encourage others to uphold if they wanted to escape degeneracy.' And he is right. But. I am a degenerate. In sex land and in relationship land. I am a flat out degenerate. Fucking girls I don't know with out condoms. Allowing random hippy bitches who've probably been through hundreds of guys hip on my dick after 3 hours. Fucking fat girls. Fucking liberals. Yeah man, I'm a degenerate. I admit it and I don't know if I want to stop. I want to increase the quality of hoe that I'm pulling. Reasonable Chi - I'll let you live mate. I've been fighting against you ever since you came on the scene. There is a level of reason that should be in your life and I will stick around here and there to squirt some of it on top of that lizard brain. For now, though, go for gold. The shit you used to be on girl-wise, get on it again. Focus on the bunnies. You said it yourself. That is the last desirable group that you have not had significant experience in. CONQUER THE BUNNIES. pt 2 I am officially unretiring. I'm coming back. Nigga, if these bitches want sex to start the relationship, best believe that's what they gon get. I'm on it. I need a revival. I need to experience the extreme pain of leaving my car to pull-up. The extreme pain that could be extreme power or extreme motivation depending on my mental state. Go through some of the material again. Write down and practice some of the lines and tonality. I know this is poorly timed since you have an interview next week... PSYCH!! This shit is what got you the GE shit in the first place, my nigga, This is the shit that has gotten you every great thing that you have ever enjoyed in your life and ypu ill stay ion this path and do even greater things with what you have given youseld. Take that Vermont gaze and confidence and attention ant take it to Boston. Take it to Providence. Make. heavy. moves. my. nigga. You know physically you are one of the most attractive men in the area. All you have to do is combine that with the words. Combine that with the body language and the tonality. Cerate the package that hte peope have been waiting for. CONQUER THE BUNNIES. My nigga if you can find a way to capture and keep those 3-second attention spans, you will own the world. CONQUER THE BUNNIES."
i'm doing solid,2021-05-14 18:46:00,"I'm not doing bad at all. Actually pretty good. I'm well settled into Kirkland, my apartment is solid and furnished with a bed that's comfortable enough, I have 2-3 connections for fun, my body is looking better as I eat more, I'm getting free rompers next week because of my instagram, and people in the world still like me. I'm doing well.Still have a feeling sometimes when all is quiet. It's a feeling of longing or loneliness. and it's in those moments that thoughts of mary come up. I have the urge to text here and ask to be her friend again. I have the urge to look at what she's doing knowing that nothing will satisfy the feeling gnawing at my heart.So I've been doing release exercises. Breathe in the thing, hold it in my mind, and breathe out thus letting that thing go. Repeat until the mind is empty. Stay present. Be happy. Keep moving. Truly, things are going well. I feel like in the past, I've only come on here in moments of extreme pain. I want to change that. Hello, Chi. You are loved."
Leaving Moscow - 37,2018-06-02 20:49:00,"Took a day of bullshit but I bagged another Russian girl. I got her number the night before and she was too drunk so nothing happened. this one was one where I almost got caught by the girls dad... I think there is a longer story written out about it. if not, I will write it soon. -- just realized I never penned it highlights met a girl again for pictures, invited her out, ignored her to tlak to a different girl, apologized and promised ot hang out later, struck out with the girl I opted for so I texted her, went over to her place in a taxi, almost got fucked out of all my money by the driver but she talked him down, went to the store to buy wine, drank wine with her and her friend, convinced her friend to take clothes off and do a naked photoshoot, took her home in a car, went into her parents place, convinced her to have sex, calmed her down and wooed her back to liking me after she started freaking out, had sex again but this time was better, almost got caught by her step dad twice, I had to barrel roll off of the bed into the corner to avoid being caught, I stayed with her and she made me food before I left, I left because I had a date with a different girl who was wonderful and wholesome and then I went out with a third girl in the evening"
not mentally castrated - almost last pool party of the year,2022-08-15 08:08:00,"went to a pool party at tao beach club today (yesterday technically). it was wild fun luda it’s performed like an hour of music and I was dancing with a girl in the crowd and had several moments of controlling the mood.super funthat said, i was with a couple girls - cute young girls from LA. they were dancing with me for a min. i was the only guy in the crowd they knew - they danced with me and I introduced them to some other random lit people that I had met. good times. on of the girls started dancing with a guy so i kinda tried dancing with the cuter smaller one. she wasn’t receptive so i danced with instead of with her if ya mean. then this dude with fuggin blue contacts or blue eyes, idk, pulled up and that girl got so excited. he just had her in 2 seconds and it was over. the second girl ended up coming back to me and dancing on me but i couldn’t figure out any legit way to escalate. to be fair, she didn’t really turn around and face me which is half the thing - like if they are facing you and dancing then there are first time make out opportunities… that said as the blue eyed nigga demonstrated, you can make out from the front dancing position as well. i just didn’t have the balls to really push it and i wasn’t really getting vibesso to end this, it was a fun pool party. my only one of summer 2022. wild that the year has gone this way. such an absolute rollercoaster but an abject drought when it comes to pussy. first summer in almost 10 years that i haven’t been laid. can you imagine? insanefor this pool party though, upon reflection , i didn’t really have any real sets. sure i talked to everyone and had fun with many groups but i didn’t actually approach any specific girls with the explicit intent of having a male female interaction. i can’t really say anything about vegas culture until i can explicitly conquer this. its quite annoying that somehow as a self professed professional with almost 10 years under my belt, that I still can’t do the one thing that I’ve spent all this time cultivating.i didn’t even try though so I can’t even be mad at myself. it’s more a lack of focus imo than it is en explicitly lack of skill. I don’t know if those girls would have worked out overall anyway… other girls could have though. if they weren’t giving the vibes, keep the shit up and moving with the next ting. lord knows i was getting iois left and right. i’m not actually castrated… i just wish that i really had a strong self identity again. before it was 100% engineer or aspiring and i was a goat who wanted to fuck. that’s all. now i’m a teacher aspiring social media personality aspiring editor aspiring return to corporate who doesn’t like going out but also loves itwho isn’t a hoe but who wants to fuck a lot of girls but with less effort who loves and hates himself.paradoxes galoreit’s interesting the going out thing. i mainly dislike going out because i see it as a waste of precious time that I could be doing anything else. the opportunity cost kills me and in the end, that’s a big reason i am not pursuing girls like oi used to - the opportunity cost has me at gunpointand even that makes no fucking sense since i mean if i’m out, i might as well enjoy and try and get some pussy. that only opportunity cost of not doing the thing that you are doing is not getting to enjoy and experience that thing that you are doing. dumbass lolso if i’m going to do some shit, i should fully do it. it will me hard on days that I actually do real game. not necessarily but possibly since it’s been so long and i have distinct walls and fears and habits of non action built back up. we gon build back better though from a positive standpoint. lol i really just wanted to use that quote, i don’t love it here but that is what popped into my brain.good night good sir"

planning,2018-05-10 16:48:00,"What do I want to do. I have put a lot of content into my dayone diary so apologies for the lack of content. posterity will be hard with my content spread across three platforms like this (iphone notes, blogger, dayone) but someday I will consolidate everything. I want to meet girls. I want to learn Russian. I want to gain motivation to learn Russian. I want to make new friends. I am nervous and scared though. Why? I am scared of taking action. I'm scared of the inevitable failure. I'm scared of trying these new things, going to countries with completely different languages and cultures. I'm definitely uneasy. It is a weird feeling. It is a feeling where the future, the next actions that I should take are truly unknown. I do not know what I should do, what I should focus on, whether I should vlog of make videos about my experiences. I just don't know. There is no wat to alleviate that. There is only to swim into life with open eyes and open arms. I hope that I will recieve my signing bonus withing the next week. This in itself would radically change my outlook on the trip. I would be able to stay comfortable in Moscow for 1-2 weekends and then comfortably leave saint petersburg knowing I left without much on the line. I know the extent to which I need to be approaching. I have subconscously been ruling certain contexts out... mohter daughter, fauther-daughter, groups, public, airports, grocery stores, from car, in the street etc. and these were the places where I thrived as a young one. I've been saying I need ot get back to the freedom I felt for those last few months of Baltimore. That neive feeling where the world was mine and nothing could touch me. The Kanye level of confidence where for someone ot not want to be with me says more about them than me. The internalizing of all game concepts into this beautiful caucofany of action and game and will and beauty."
vascillation pt 2,2017-08-26 22:39:00,"Also, watching game of thrones and reading the Course of Love book are making me long for an arranged marriage. The same battles exist regardless and the success or failure of the marriage solely depends on your willingness to negotiate and stay in the relationship. Beauty is wonderful and is necessary for the next 40 years but after, that shit is gone. What does this mean for my game? I've long suspected this. Theoretically, I am and can be compatible with everyone on the earth. After a tiny bit of game, you realize that every girl is game. Every girl can be wooed. It has nothing to do with personality specifics, career, money or even words. This shit is body language. This non-revelation means nothing though. I will continue to look for the girl that I found in Daria. I'll keep looking for the girl I found described 2 posts ago (from Boston). I have something in mind that would make my eternal commitment easier than not. The only way to find out if a girl qualifies is to speak."
47 - married woman,2018-12-12 00:05:00,"I told myself and other people that I wouldn't do it but I did. I went back and did it. I cucked this poor man. How do I feel? there is a kind of powerful feeling that comes from cucking this powerful ass dude. Even through the prize wasn't that great, it was about closing the loop. It was extremely dangerous and degenerate of my but that is almost what is needed now to get me out of the proverbial bed. The pussy was deep. I didn't like eating her out because of the floppiness of the lips and the general look. I do not like eating pussy that has a taste. Fucking disgusting. I know how to do it but goddamn I don't like it. I also found a new thing where my dick doesn't stay hard the whole time. If I really start getting affected or disgusted mentally, the dick does not stay hard. This is an interesting development. This might force me to be better in what I'm choosing as a partner. I'm close to hitting 50. I want to hit 50 before the end of the year. This is very doable though it might get hard. technically we have less than 20 days to complete the mission. I accept the burden along with the creation and nurturing of the ideas that I plan on publicly putting out there on the internet. Driving traffic to the blog is one of the things that will be fun to do but further finding ways to generate revenue from this new platform. I think separate websites for hoetry and travel are going to be the move. Once procure the affiliate tools from the 3 websites, kiwi, aribnb and hostel world, I will be off to the races. I also know that no one reads anymore so driving people to this website will be partly illusory. I will have to supplement the reading content with vlog type videos. good luck chi. You are an evil person and that is fine. That term holds no power over you anymore. That moral center that you have been fighting to hold onto despite there being no evidence to keep it is gone. I think there are things that I will maintain as far as behaviors go but the ban has been lifted. I don't know why I went and fucked that old bish even withe the potential danger of the situation. I did it because I fucking could. I have been giving into my vices regularly as of late. I like the idea of rewarding myself with positive things like going to the gym. And I think I will start that today."
94 - ole russian girl,2021-07-19 07:13:00,met a random old 50+ year old russian woman who i banged out. she was on her period. we met when i was supposed to hang out with another girl but i went ahead and banged her instead.
i failed jack again - should i be a teacher,2019-06-10 06:50:00,"I feel that I understand these concepts that I'm putting out into the world and then almost immediately I'm confronted with the reality of the world in that the simple kindergarten concept that I am trying to logically explain through words and actions is actually so far from a normal person's reality that it isn't recognized by their mind. It literally isn't coming through at any level. And that is the most frustrating thing on the planet earth for me and for that person. W are both communicating but on different wavelengths. I understand why RSDTyler doesn't coach the noobs anymore. It isn't possible for someone that is semi-enlightened and present to the world around them to identify with the way that someone is feeling outside of that state. The response is, ""dude just do this, then this, then this, then this, and then you will be in the mood to socialize."" but when step one isn't doable, is there any room for improvement. Can you even meaningfully engage in the conversation of the situation? no. The answer is no. And if Jack was anyone else tonight, I would have left him in the dust. I have no patience for bad energy and I paid homage to the years-long respect and friendship that we have by sitting with him tonight and having that conversation and interaction. For some fucking reason, he couldn't get out of a negative headspace. He was so deep that even when a girl that he worked with walked by, recognized the situation and started hugging and kissing him in the street to make him feel better, he still ended up angry at me... when that happens. I don't fucking know what to do. I can't do anything. I don't know what to do to change this mane or make him act differently. And the fact of the matter is, there is nothing that could have done to make him ac different. We are all on our own path. Once you explained yourself once, further bullshitting and repeating the same story isn't going to add new information or change anyone's lives. fuck off. [letter to my mans that he will never see] You can be extremely entertaining and funny when you are doing your standup and interactions in the right context. In the right places, the shit that you are doing is magical and the next level. the connection that you can generate from your openness to people is astounding and enviable. When it is not working though, it is a trainwreck. [Sunday] I introduced you to a couple people that I have been friends with for a long time. We start having conversations that are open to general input from anyone that is sitting new by or who wants to participate. I understand the feeling of being outside of a group and looking for a place to contribute and add value. You did not succeed here in this try, which is fine, but I think it is important that you learn from this. No one is mad at you or thinks less of you. We have all been there and we know where your head is at and where you are coming from with your slightly too loud, slightly belligerent, frenetic, awkward energy. It's okay. Your stories here did not add value... they were attempts to connect with people who don't know you and thus don't care about the story that you are going to tell. I don't know how to describe it... but I will try. If you have value in their eyes, they will want to hear the story that you are going to tell. There is not much of a difference between a story that you will tell versus a story that Joe Rogan would tell as far as the content goes. The main difference is the context where Joe Rogan has the value and respect in the eyes of the people around him. That value and respect can be generated through fame, demeanour, tone, body language and through the content of the discussion that you are having with people. Generally, though, my opinion is that you have to build up more social capital to just be telling people stories about your life... You have to be an extremely funny person that has mastered storytelling and knows the highs and lows and knows how to hit the punch line of the story and how to finish it off at the end. If you don't have the social capital, you end up telling the story to .a lot of people who have blank faces and who want to interrupt with something to drive you off of the path and get on to something more fun that they can engage with. I and others notice these social cues to shut the fuck up about that boring ass story and more on to something that we can also have fun with. The other thing is in your delivery. I will complete this later."
idk what to talk about but I want to post so...,2016-11-03 08:07:00,"Hi This is probably the first post that I am making not under duress. I am not falling apart. I ma merely making a commentary on my life. Again, I am trying to maintain my existence outside of my comfort zone. Although, is there any space for not wanting to do something? For example, if I am heading home after work one day and I don't feel like talking to girls at Furman or Clemson, is it good for me to force the drive and the interactions? Or should I chill? I have been chilling but in the past, I would have seen this as unacceptable. I don't need to constantly game because I have the skillset to succeed already. I could always get better but it is draining to go out so often. Almost of the point where I start to dislike women. I find that I function the best if I gear up for an hour or two before I go out with the proper mentality. I personally need to make myself some motivational videos so that I can be relying on things that I already know and not external persons (namely RSD). I have done a decent job of balancing out my life but there are days when I will just look around and observe and feel fine as an introvert. Zero interactions in that daytime with anyone but myself. That is healing for me. It is good to have time to myself where I completely let go of any intent to approach anyone on the street. I get to just look around and observe life. This would be the perfect mentality to have when daygaming but that might taint that pure expression of life. Best to keep this separate at least for now. Is there anything else? yes, I am awesome. I have the ability to make a girl fall for me somehow. I did it this weekend in Columbus. I think it was a combination of my honesty and looks. I have mastered conversation to say what I need to say without revealing my political positions. That is the only thing that separates me from 99% of the females that I meet while I'm out. The default position of polite society is 'fuck trump', 'fuck republicans', and 'everything is racist and sexist'. This is trivial to navigate but it does suck that I can't fully express that part of myself. Should a difference in political opinion prevent me from having sex with a girl? Theoretically, yes. At this current stage in my life though, I feel like I would lose out on a lot fun experiences by setting that boundary. I do need some additional standards, specifically when it comes to attraction. I say this because I have settled for some evil acts in the past when I have the ability to do great things. I don't settle for less in my professional life because I don't have to. I need to create that framework in my personal life. There were a couple things that Shelby said that I percieve as red flags. Namely, after expressing that she was a bisexual and I said we should have threesomes, she said,""My sexuality isn't a prize for men to get and be excited with."" There is nothing wrong with that statement but it is indicative of a deeper social justice warriory attitude that is toxic for society and has the ability to destroy me should I get on its bad side. She also mentioned that she was a part of the LGBTQ community and pretty much everyone that claims that shit is a degenerate whom I have not business having any dealings with. The thing was she was attractive and had a big butt. Haha. That is pretty much it. I held most of the jokes. I don't even remember what I said. All I know is that I was saying a lot and doing minimal. I definitely framed myself as a keeper more than a one time or multiple time fun thing. I'm not sure how to frame the latter. I see myself as perhaps too scared to scare off the girl with bluntness or honesty of what I really want from them: sex. I am trying to become more of a person so I think that this may be fine but any fear associated with expressing an honest interest for only sex or an actual relationship would be good to start. :) Still becoming a person. AY roll credits."
be better,2017-09-20 21:34:00,"I met a man the other day. He is beautiful and a junior in industrial engineering. He talked to the same companies that I talked to and received job offers on the spite despite his lack of being the correct age or level in school. I did not receive those things. I need to be better. I have pain that comes from cold approaching. I was decent at it and that was part of what made me who I am. I know i have talked about getting back to my roots but this is a moment where it is starting to affect my life. I am not as good as used to be. I have gotten comfortable in my nonsense. I have gotten comfortable not being the best. I know that I do not deserve to be in the position to get an interview for this GE chemical engineering job. I know I am not good enough to get into a non-safety rotational engineering program. My work ethic is trash and I do thing that people can see through shit when it is shit. I am masquerading as Chi. I need to go soul search and create a-new the man who I need to be. This does not mean looking back at history at how things used to be done. This is about remaining present and making myself better than I ever was. Resume doesn't means shit if you can't walk up and charm the pants off of someone. I need to be better. I need to be sexy. I need to be comfortable with all parts of the human interaction. Beginning e.g. the opener, the middle e.g. building rapport, and the end e.g. the close/pull. Get better for you and get better for those around you. There has been a trend where you just talk about all this shit. You just talk about the old days. You just talk about the way things used to be. You just brag about your current level of non-success. Do not be proud of your lack of success. Do not parade it around as a badge of honor. With the amount of years that you have been participating in game, you should have already achieved that different level of success. 6 girls a semester is trash. Out of the amount of pull-ups that you have partaken in, this number should be near 20 or 30. Hello, my name is Chi. I will be better."
Field report - first hinge lay (61),2019-09-07 11:01:00,"This was interesting. It actually should have been my second hinge lay but I made the mistake of talking about politics during the first date. The shitty part was that the girl gave me so so many chances to change the subject but I just wouldn’t let up. She literally got up to use the bathroom at least 4 or 5 times, and I never took the bait. I just kept plowing and eventually she left. The date today went way better. Strong eye contact from the get go. She was cute. Not hot, but definitely pretty. She was almost as tall as me... probably a bit taller with her small heels. She started our conversation on alcohol and took it through movies and music. We bonded over our mutual liking of High School Musical and this was when I kissed her. I didn’t really like her kissing. It always seemed like her tongue was in the way. She kissed with her whole mouth forward instead of just the lips forward or just the tongue forward. There wasn’t a lot of nuance there but then again this is better than tinsel hockey so who and I to complain. Whenever I get a mouth like this I always just end up messing around since I actually don’t know what the fuck to do. From there, I asked if she lived in DC. She said yes and I followed up with an inquiry about whether she had alcohol on hand. She said she did and I suggested we swing by her place for a drink before heading to a real club. She agreed and we walked back to her place. We started making out after she took the alcohol out and she asked me if I wanted to go up to her room. I said yes. Once up there we made out on the bed for maybe 3 minutes before she removed all her clothes except her bra. I did the same and started fucking her a bit. She was nice and wet though I could tell that it was a bit herd for her. I must be doing something wrong because basically every girl that I have had sex with has similar reactions to getting penetrated by me. I am feeling the need to end it because I feel that she will want to end it soon. That was the case here because after maybe 5-7 minutes of fucking she said something and moved a bit. I don’t remember what she said but it felt like she needed a break. I removed myself and laid beside her, asking if she was okay. She said yes and asked if I’d be mad if we stopped for the night. I said disappointed but not mad. We proceeded to go deep on a lot of subjects. I like talking so I did a lot of it. She didn’t seem like she was going to share whatever deep shit was bothering her so I talked and talked. We covered religion and drugs mostly. After this talk, which probably lasted between .5 and 1 hour, we started making out again. She got on top and I came in her within a 2-3 minutes. It was dumb. It was a relief to be able to officially count the notch but it was dumb. I would have really liked to lay there and fall asleep with her. These one night things suck. I went out from there. The first place I went was a vibe. Opened a set of guys and turns out they were old school DJs. I talked with them for awhile before realizing that I had left my car keys at this girls house. No biggie. Ran back to her place, grabbed em and headed back out. This time I went to Takoda. I stopped on the downstairs floor. I opened a 2 set near the entrance with a compliment to the cuter girl about her jacket. I joked about it looking expensive and she was far above us because of this coat. She said she got it from Zara and I joked saying that it must be a Zara in Paris or New York. From there, the set hooked pretty well, We somehow got into conversation about her trip to burning man with her dad. She showed me some pics and then we talked further of how pretty it was out west and what it was like at this festival. The issue with this set was that there was no sexual tension or energy. It was very informational and surface level. I needed premise. She kinda got up to walk away and I immediately opened one of her friends that was walking by. Same open, compliment and demanding to know what important job she does. She said she works for Unilever selling soap. I mention that that company was big in Europe and she said she just came back from a trip to Amsterdam. I joked about how many drugs she must’ve done. When she said none, I think I teased her about being wholesome or being boring. I accused he of likely riding a bike everywhere and going to bed at 1030. She seemed to be enjoying it. She did say that she rode a bike. I then mentioned that it was a bit uncomfortable there because of the women in the windows. It was at this moment that her friends pulled her upstairs and I told her I’d see her up there. When I went upstairs, I was overwhelmed. Too many people and none of the sets were warm or looking openable. Everyone was in a group and there were a lot of mixed sets. That’s par for the course, I know. I hugged the railing near the entrance for 5-10 minutes trying to decide how to take this. I saw some commotion near the center of the bar. Apparently, one of the floorboards had gotten loose and the bouncers were blocking that area off. I opened a mixed set with a comment on someone literally tearing up the dance floor. It went fine and lasted night on 20 seconds. I then open a 2 set walking by. I joke further about the dance floor then pivot to their outfits, asking why they looked fancy. I don’t remember the answer. I asked their names and danced and joked further about the broken dance floor. They seemed to be enjoying my presence. I tried to get in further by remarking that they did not look like they were from DC. I ran a mini routine that I used to do in Colorado where I tell people that people from whatever city I’m in are uptight and stuck up while people from out of town are more fun and down to earth. From there I went on to tease the one girl about her name... I told she sounded like bad news. I then went on to make up stereotypes about people with her name, stuff like they would be fun but get us all in trouble, etc. Wasn’t bad but they kinda started losing interest. Not sure how the set ended but I just found myself alone and opened another 2-3 set nearby that was dancing. I made another joke about the broken dance floor and danced in place with them. It was going fine for about 30 seconds. The first girl had kinda moved on so I tried to use a teasey premise line with the second girl, “You are actually kinda cute. Who are you?” She did not like this at all haha. She made some crazy faces and repeated the word Kinda several times. Then she went to her friends and told them and then looked at me. I literally didn’t know what to say. So she dismissed me. I immediately open a 3 set 2 girls (one chubbyish, one cute) 1 guy right beside them. This was just to be doing something so I didn’t feel lame after trying that line and having it fall flat. The conversation went decent. I found out the one girl and guy were dating. Another girl came to stand by the window we were nearby. I started talking to her a bit... she said she really wanted to jump out of the window onto the roof. I joked with her about that and told her I would film it. Then the girlfriend and boyfriend left along with the window girl, leaving me with the kinda chubby leftover girl. I talked to her. She gave me the rest of her drink which I sipped and used as a prop for the rest of the night. From here my night basically was over. After the chubby girl, I tried to open a girl that was in a big group... she ignored me. So I opened the guy right beside her and vibe with him a bit about being fun and not being from the area. Fun interaction. During that he was approached by a girl, who he started talking to and I started talking to a nearby mixed guy. This guy was drunk as shit but it turned out that we were born in the same city in Maryland. To finish the night, I kinda stuck around and half assed a pull of the chubby girl and window girl. They were kinda down to go to a different club called Hatch. I googled it and it was a 30m walk. No good. Some dudes approached and said that they were probably going to get pizza and postgame. That was a better option for the girls. I don’t know if I could have won that interaction or not but it just didn’t seem worth the effort to me. There was a probably 30m to an hour left to game at a different spot after Takoda closed, but I decided to call it and slide home to finish some python code I had been trying to get through earlier on in the day. I’m comfortable with the amount of sets that I did tonight. Sticking points • Premise off of platonic conversations when I’m not in a flow state. I have to get better at judging what type of premise to lead in with and when to inject it • Eliminate the hesitation to approach and talk to the big groups. Be shameless. You won’t remember the failure if it doesn’t work out so why not go for gold • Be more brazen and shameless in the street. You do a good job about this when you are with other guys but you don’t do a lot of the street stops while out alone What went well • Sex after a date - hinge text game and texting in general is getting bomb • Hooked 2-3 sets of girls that I was attracted to • Solved the coding problem as soon as a got back to my car • Wrote this whole long ass post Random fact: the hinge girl has a masters in social work and works as a therapist for eating disorders at a mental hospital"
on a roll - hit 91 yesterday with this azer chick who's married,2021-05-23 23:42:00,"YeahWell I don't feel great today - two things are different than normal. One i tried doing bridges yesterday which has resulted in my back being sore as fuck. Second, I fucked a hoe without a condom. Oh and also I ate a lot of candy and watched a movie for a long time into the night. I think I'd be fine with the back thing.Candy seems to be the necessary consolence that I tru to use when I do something objectively bad for myself. Something that truly hurt me. I see that from college and I see that those times have continues to today. It's a comfort in the face of doing something that was felt bad. The thing that felt bad or really just didn't feel like anything was the sex with the girl.Funny enough I've had this feeling about sex since the first girl I had sex with and throughout these years. I've just ignored it in favor of getting my number higher. I have to stop that. I will stop that. I can't keep going like this. Pussy is something but truly, putting yourself in danger for the sake of a number is stupid. It's completely out of character and doesn't make any sense in any scheme of things that you are trying to do. I think I'd be cool with fucking in general if I was confident that the girl was clean and not banging every other person. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this country. My friend Chi, this has got to be the last one. 91 was a cool number. Truly. But from here on, you can't bang American girls without condoms or STD testing. You don't feel anything? Cool, you don't care for it anyway. It's truly just putting your penis in a hole for a minute and getting the fuck out of there. The sex that you have with the complete lack of chemistry is garbage. I won't stand for it and I'm not here for it.Have fun with you dancing and all that and go home alone. I give the condom thing as an out because it is a solution to that thing... at least partially but damn. I mean even with that. I just don't think it should be a thing for you. I know you have the number 100. it's a cool number. I know you on principle want to put up numbers. I get it. we past this though. man. like fuck super hot girls or girls you really really fucking like. Not this girl. She's fine but she's not a girl that you should be with. Full stop. If you were to just look at her and interact with her for a few minutes, you understand that. And in general, you understand that about most of the girls that you are interacting with, interestingly enough. There is a type of person that is open and free and fun that I really vibe with and that person doens't come up normally. be patient.Not much else to say about this subject. Truly though, this does nothing for you so why are you continuing to do it."
maybe my letter to my wife in my gift to her,2021-06-25 02:43:00,"to my wife maryyou know i never felt like i was really married till now. I never felt that i loved a girl till now. till you. you're family. and as we get older while we may grow apart know that I will always love you and will always cherish you in my heart and mind while I'm alive. This book helped me a lot in the few months we didn't speak. Maybe one day it could help you too... it could also be too nerdy for you which would understand. But if you're ever searching for meaning or spirituality or even just want to practice your english with a simple book, read this!"
communication with the unconscience,2022-10-24 06:03:00,"Hey matewe uplots of conversation lately. I'm doing well even through it seems like things are wild in all of these blog posts. There are lots of good ideas for the future. It does seem like a funnel and that there are only two or three real paths towards something but that isn't necessarily true.The paths that I'm really looking at are thus:Move to LA somehow and sew clothes for peoplePros-lots of networking opportunities and chances to make shitI have some friends there alreadyleast monetary risk bc usacan make clothes Cons-It's in AmericaIt's not as adventurous as other thingsMove to Georgia in January or February with homies from LebanonProsAdventureUse my RussianRussian and Georgian girls there // overflow from people leaving RussiaCons-Monetary Risk//idk if i can make clothes bc disposable income for fabric // who knows if i can access supplies thereRussian English teaching job pulls through and go to RussiaProsadventureuse my russianrussian girlsI have many connects there and would assuredly be successful with applicationConssignificant monetary riskwho knows if i can make clothes therefleeing population // potentially failing stateOther options that I don't like but could do if I gave upLearn how to code and get online job (1-2 years)Learn how to edit and get in person // online job in LA (1-2 years)Learn how to fashion design and go into the industry (1-2 years)Wild options that I dare not considerBuy a plane ticket somewhere bring a suitcase and surviveThe weight of society weighs down on me. My impulse to just leave is high. I like the idea of being out in the world. It would be uncomfortable - I probably can't image the discomfort that I could be in if I left civilization. But in the face of a menial boring life of watching things and casually doing things, that seems preferable. To live and to die.The search for the thing. I know as a human there is a 'correct' way to live. It seems that to create goals, live in the moment and dopamine yourself on that journey, refuse to celebrate the win or to celebrate in moderation and continue on the path - to have friends and family that you communicate with on a daily and or weekly basis - to have something big that one is living for whether that's family, religion or some bigger business or personal venture - those things give life meaning from day to day and the irony of searching far and wide for something is that the something is probably right in front of you the entire time.Still, fuck all that, I want to be outside. I can see the pain of that future. The longing for solace and comfort in the face of hunger, pain and misery. I can image the beginning of such a future. Of course not necessarily, but possible after a few failures - oh my.Am I really afraid of death though? What is the cost of living? What is the cost of finding that which keeps you waking up day after day week after week?"
not sure why I bother,2017-04-12 21:49:00,"It's annoying. Girls not texting back is annoying. I came to an ultimatum the other night that going out at night is impossible for me in this current state. I know that this is mostly a result of me not succeeding and thus making up excuses for not ballsing up and doing the actions necessary to be socially free regardless of context BUT it is going to be much easier on my studies if I just stay in. I can become the introvert long enough to get the grades to move on in life. I can only do so much rejection and disappointment at one time. Right now I'm facing life exile, through not passing one of the core classes in my major, a money-less summer because no internship worked out so far, and life wants me to add rejection from women to the docket. No thanks. For some reason, I seem to be going through a dip in life where now school is going better and better and everything else suffers. I can't devote any more time to women than I already do. I could do more day game but that ould mean more rejection. I know the whole schtick about viewing rejection differently but at the end of the day, it's disappointing. A person that yo wanted to form a relationship with decided that they didn't want that same thing. Sure it sucks for them too because they don't get to experience how awesome I am but that doesn't change the fact that I still don't have that relationship with that person. The only solution is to be in a place of abundance so that you don't notice when people choose not to be in relationships with you. Since I don't think I can produce that and go to school, and since this disappointment hinges on having that, the logical solution is CHILL NIGGA. bye."
new questions about this relationship,2020-06-27 07:44:00,"What do I want with other girls and other relationships? I like the adventure of it. I like the feeling of talking and seducing a girl and even after, getting her to feel comfortable loosening up around me and showing me the real her. I like the sex. I like the look on a girl's face when I first put my dick inside of them, the feeling when I can make them cum during sex, the feeling when I first touch their vaginas and see how crazy wildly wet and excited they are for me. What is love? Is it just what happens when you spend a significant amount of time with a person and have special experiences and memories with them? If so, for friendships, this is okay - but for relationships, can I really say that Mary or any other girl I date is special when seemingly several girls could have the same type of relationship given time and special experiences? If love is something different, am I capable of this extra magical thing? Would I experience a special deeper magical feeling if I dated a prettier girl with the type of personality and dancing that I like (like Sayora)? Is it okay to tell Mary that I love her considering the uncertainty of the above questions? Is it okay to stay with Mary when she wants an exclusive relationship? Is it selfish of me to keep her? Of course, it's selfish. Is it okay though? She wants me but is it healthy for us both to hold onto this? I really don't see how any relationship in the future could be different than this. I will still see models in the street and want to talk to them. I will still see models in the club and want to sleep with them."

icarus fallen pt 2,2016-06-07 21:34:00,"p59 Icarus Fallen ""Today, however, we refuse to even ask ourselves the questions, ""What is true?"" so that the only question that remains for us is to ask, ""How can we live well?"""" I love this. This is how I reacted and changed who I was in my sophomore/junior/3rd year of school. I became an ideologue, constantly searching for the truth and debate. I was beat to hell and lost a lot of sex as a result of my beliefs. It was not fun to walk around and it became difficult to associate with college women because they are all goddamn socialists who haven't ever thought about anything in their lives. Nor have they had any opinion of their own. In order to have more sex and improve my relationships, I thought, ""what can I do to now have more sex?"". And that thing was to approach more women, look up more instruction from professionals about how to talk and interact with them, and stop talking to them about true things that matter. That turned into me losing all my values and ignoring all of what I had come to know as true. My life search question became the 'how can I live well'. This is an awesome book."
the ego,2016-10-05 16:49:00,"I know my ego is at fault for the recent developments in my life. The ego protection is what holds you back from talking to that one girl in the gym because you don't have to and you could but you are better than that. Or the excuse is that you will do it later or that it will en up like all your other interactions because all women are shit and the same. On some level, I really do not like women. I don't like their emotional reactions to bullshit. I am aware that males have been increasingly becoming feminine and acting similarly which is bullshit. That's why I really don't fuck with niggas or homosexuals. Anyway. There are a few women that I am able to appreciate and if I am able to dive past my ego and bitch butterflies and experience certain women, I do genuinely enjoy myself and they enjoy me. I don't know why I am writing this. Oh yeah. I am being evicted. Haha not a big deal through because I move quickly and I have friends and resources. I have a full understanding on how to find a place quickly and how to live among males who I do not know. This living with women thing is bullshit and has really lent to my further dislike of females. I am constantly accused of being dirty and am held to a standard that no one else in the house is held to. Everyone else is allowed to leave dishes in the sink. Everyone else is allowed to leave dishes to dry on the counter, in the dishwasher, etc. Everyone else is allowed to eat on the couch. Which is all bullshit. This is what living with a dysfunctional woman is like. And I hate it and I will never be part of it. It makes sense that this guy is gay and his sister is a hoe who is going no where in life when their mother was a single mom who has been married and divorced twice or more in the duration of her having kids and apparently both were unhappy marriages hence the divorce. There's no other way that such a family can end up. That is why I am scared of living on this earth in 5-10 years because these dysfunctional individuals who don't know how to reason or express themselves in a productive manner are going to be running the world. Imagine having a passive aggressive president with a period. Imagine one of these vaginified males leading the country into a new war against someone who called a random girl fat. This shit is going to end the earth, I'm sure of it. Anyway. I forgot how fun it is to talk to random girls. It really is awesome. I get a solid release of some chemical in my head when I see the smile spread from cheek to cheek as the girl slowly realizes that she has found a real male who has thoughts and isn't afraid to engage with her to express them. This is an uncommon thing. All women want me to talk to them. That is a ridiculous claim. Okay. Most girls that look at me have a switch click in their mind where if I were to go over to her and engage in a respectful yet challenging conversation she would like it and have sex with me. Now, a lot of you just fell off of your seat at the leap in logic and that is fine. I definitely don't have sex with most of the girls that I talk to and I often lose girls that I really should be having sex with. I am fixing that. Really now, I just need to go out more and break down the ego that has formed around my lifting and the general increase in my attractiveness. My life is going the way it should be going. I have a good job (internship), I have more muscle on my person than ever before in my life, I have a beautiful beard, I know a lot of things about a lot of subjects, I feel comfortable talking about most things, and I have a good face. So what I am really trying to do (not trying hard enough but I will) is kill that ego by taking responsibility for my flaws and talking to people. My ego doesn't think I'm too good for people (some people it does as a spoke about earlier i.e. the one current female roommate and most blacks and most liberals), it just knows that rejection is everywhere and the less interaction I have with people the less chance I have of being rejected. The more I stick with dancing, and interacting in circles that I am familiar with the less chance I will be rejected by people in those circles. That is why it is imperative for me to go out and get rejected by new groups and feel that discomfort and understand that I am not perfect and that I can not accomplish all things. After all, I am still becoming a person."
boring repetitive quick speil,2016-06-29 11:11:00,"Damn, it really is too bad. When you meet someone awesome and never get to see them again. It’s like I’m always on the wrong side of destiny. I just need to set back and relax. I need to cool off and actually get to know the people that I want to get to know. The problem is the people that re my best buddies, I am already good friends and pals with and those with whom I am disposed to hang out with on a regular basis are people that I don’t like. I meet people all the time that I want in my life for longer but it just seems not to work out all of the time. Especially if the human being is a woman (haha yes I do think some of them are people) (not all though). It is frustrating to be vulnerable in somone’s direction. It is frustrating to kinda open up but then realize that you opening up might hve been coming from a needy place and you realize that the girl actually wasn’t talking too much and that you wouere dominating the interaction and that in the end she thinks you’ree a little boy chode who can’t handle his shit. I seem to always erode back to the original Chi. The guy who just wants to talk and if yo can’t keeeep up with him and if you don’t have the balls to interrupt, he will rule the room. I like that gy in moderation but now he seemed to come and dominate more often. He comes in at spurts of massive action, being cool and fun. But it never lasts. The childboy comes back. The one who hasn’t fucked any girls, the one who is scared to make a move, the one that wants to spill all of his blood and guts to someone he has just met because he doesn’t have someone to normally talk to. I have this constant pressure in my heart when I meet a girl that I actually want to spend time with and I don’t like it. I have fought for years to destroy that shit to the point where I actually don’t feel anything for any of these gils except that I want to sleeps with them. And I resent them for that. I resent them for forcing me to have to change in order to get them and be likeable. The normal Chi isn’t that guy. And for that matter who is the normal Chi. I don’t have a normal. My default is weird. I talk ot myself, read books, listen to mildly racist content, subscribe to anarchist writers, and listen to violent rap music all the while singing my sweet ed Sheeran and taylor swift. I am prone to be awesome at times and weird at other times. I am not at my full level of social status. I am slowly working my way up and I get thrown back down quite frequently. How can I separate myself from the pack. Massive action. How can I make myself happy? Massive action."

Hello god - what to do next,2020-12-27 23:47:00,"Hello.We haven't talked in a long time. I got back with mary for a few months... one or two to be exact and we broke up today because she just couldn't get over the fact that I cheated and everyday her friends give her shit about this and the fact that I was living in her apartment with her.And I don't blame all of them.It does hurt though. It hurts to be in this situation. It hurts to lose someone I liked. Fuck, If I could just have things my way, we would be friends and she could just be letting me crash till I got back on my feet. No sex just help from one human to another human as friends. I don't want a relationship with her or with anyone else. I'm a damn animal and I want to be in the damn streets.As much as I want to deny this shit, this is that way things are. But at this moment in life, I am human garbage. I need to be cleaned up and refurbished before I can return to the streets for hunting. Goddamn I am a piece.We wouldnever be together forever. I know that. I just wanted some peace and queet. I just wanted a nie calm relationship with someone who truly loved me for how I was. But alsas my evil side got the better of me a few months ago. Hell If I'm honest wwith you I fucked Lisa last week. That's Chi. Evil Chii. Thats who I am choosing to be in this moment. I damn vagrant who has no home and who doesn't even deserve one. The proverbial prodical son. Fron the bible. So what now.I can go back to america. I can go live in my perrents house. I can work some shit job for pennies while the whole worldpasses bu. ican do that. it will hurt. It will hurt to give up my dream of building somehting and making somehitng of myself here in this country. It will hurt. damn it but it muust be done. I've got to get out. I could stay though. find a place for my things for 3 days. widdle my belongings down to the bare essentials and leave the rest to rot. I could survive on my gym money and sleep in this fantastic place that I found on accident while visitin mary's friend... but fuck lord if I can't find it anymore because I don't have my phone... damn it. dude they could have taken everything but not my damn phone. I need that shit. fuck. So what. I can ride things out. get rid of my worldly posessions, and strip down to the shit I need, couple pairs of pants, a coat and workout clothes. the gym has a washer. I could basicallylive out of there for awhile, be there all day, dance, workout and learn russian for 8 hours... maybe I can get this barber job and that can give me some case for a bit after a month or so. I could stop being homeless after the gym pays me.. I could find a hostel for 200 or 500 rubles a night and shack up there for a minute. no more helping hands from people. you are a grown ass man. and if you need another hand in russia, you leave, no if ands or buttsbut what if this is just another absurd futile try at some shit justl ike your relationship with mary? That shit shoudl have ended back in fucking august or september nigga. you had the shit figured out and the reasons to break up still remain. you aren't part of her friend group, there is very little for you both to do together other than fuck and watch movies though for htat point, it's probably similar to many couples... but nigga you was right back then.. fuck maybe you'd be in a whole different place right now if you would have dipped. but this has been a learning experience. I'm happy you put yourself through all of this even though fuck I wish there had been a different way to learn this damn lessontrust your logic. trust your fucking gut. nigga if you know the fucking correct shit to do you need ot do it. Even today when we were breaking up, mary kept offering olive branches to slow down the fall. no fuck all that shit - clean break, blocked on all platforms move on, no new years eve though damn it if i don't want a nice calm evening. fuck it though. life is here and I need to get in it. I need to dive. I need to really be here. I don't konw what you should do next... there are so many things but I do want you to do these three things at minimum daily. workout, russian, and dance. I don't give a fuck about anything else. all that other shit can stay or go but for the love of everything in this world my nigga, please, build some sort of habit. please. i beg youworkout, russian, danceyou can work, you can learn some cloud shit. you can become a developer... god knows its not too late for anything. it's your choice. What do I want though. I want to earn enough here to get another room and then grind to get more bodies. I don't give a fuck about clout or life or anything. I just know I like these small nice things and maybe they are empty on the other end... idk. i need a way to make money and save and be happy. I think I want to be a dance teacher but who the fuck actually knows about that. I want to go back to being fake important and having a job as an engineer but who the fuck knows i that is even possible either. My life is a joke but so is everyone elses. lets make the best of it.so what did you decide? Ask to see if it's possible to get your salary early. go from there"
Katie Vecchio - where is Casanova Chi,2017-10-03 02:29:00,"The woman of my formidable years... gone. Married. It's over. Well, if I'm being honest, the bitch part of me gave up a long time ago. I had my chance. Let me reminisce for some minutes. She was single. I had an opportunity. if was Fall of 2015. I remember because I lived on Conell and I did not have a car yet. I had had sex with a few women but I was very much still a newbie. I got a call while at up all night, with my phone being almost dead. Facetime actually. Wait. I think I was still in my house. Anyway, it was Katie and she was crying with her friend. I didn't fully grasp the situation and then one of them said it: she was single. I died a little bit in that moment. In a good way. I never thought in my wildest dream fantasy imaginations that this girl that I had sought and lusted after for almost 5 years could be single. It blew my mind. I literally said I am driving down to where you are right now. As I am speaking I am putting on a coat and rushing outside. I open up the Zipcar app and the car wasn't there. What the actual fuck. but then my phone is close to dying. Or I had bad service. I don't remember. All I know is is is that I ran to the mountain lair to put my phone on a charger. My phone came back to life and I again promised that I would come see her. blah blah blah, it never happened. But then again I had an even more real chance when she came back to town. I went to the Evansdale Panera with her. Lord. Why didn't I take a chance? Why didn't I shoot my shot? I literally sat there and didn't do shit. and perhaps even worse, I started talking about my successes and failures with other girls. I had nothing else. That was the only thing that mattered in my life at that time. I had no hobbies, I had no other interests and interestingly enough, I was trash at the only thing that occupied my mind for two years prior. I left that place thinking, hey we just didn't mesh when the truth of the matter was, when it mattered, when the cards were on the table, when I had the best running back in the league, I chose to throw the ball instead of running it. Shit, I mean for that analogy to even work I probably didn't even throw the damn ball. The shit got hiked and I froze and purposefully threw the interception. . It was not an accident. There are no accidents. Now, I sit here looking at the love of Cheez, the girl that I had debilitating emotions over for nigh on 5 years. How I have changed. But then again, how am I also so similar to that man that left that Panera without saying a word about how he truly felt. I feel so far away from that Casanova Chi that existed up until very recently. I'm back to having no clue what to say. I am back to being mostly wholly uninterested in having dialogues with pretty girls. I'm hanging out on my lonely and being weird for extensive hours in the day. I am de-socializing. At the same damn time, I know the spirit and the letter of the game. I could preach to the choir about what one must do to achieve successes. I am no longer at a place where I can or am capable of practicing what I preach. This is the reason why I feel so defeated on this Monday. Also, I have a test Thursday on a subject that I definitely hate, chemical engineering design, which I am convinced that I will do poorly on. I am scared for my future on all fronts. I hope in a few weeks this post turns out to be laughable reflections and the momentary depressing thoughts of a mightily successful man turned God. thoughts and prayers to you from you, brother Chi. --70 days since I've seen a pussy--"
Open Letter to Nima,2017-01-28 09:44:00,"I don’t know where to start. There are so many things on my mind right now. Since it is more fun, I will start with the actual game deconstruction of the story that I was told and then proceed to my other critiques. First. If in fact you were trying to express to her that I was a good guy, that is the wrong frame to come from. You and I both know that you, me and everyone we hang out with are better than 90% of the people we meet. We are thinkers with ability and have the potential to go and disrupt any industry with our excellence if we choose. Never try to convince someone that you are the shit. Show them or find out how they are good enough for you. The latter is easier to take action to accomplish. Instead of telling her, “Hey, my friend is actually a really awesome guy” say something like, “My friend is really picky and never talks to girls when he’s out. You must be pretty cool for him to talk to you.” Or, “Our friend group look out for each other when it comes to relationships with girls… what makes you cooler than all these other women? Why should we keep talking to you?” Those are two examples of forcing the girl to qualify herself to you rather than the opposite, which is needy and beta. Bad game. Second, you are out here to have fun. You are not out here to for your ego. You are out here to hang out with your friends and/or get laid if possible. Fighting with people is not on the ticket. Don’t get me wrong I am speaking to myself as much as I’m speaking to you. I saw the pain of trying to walk away while someone you are disagreeing with is insulting you. I, myself, couldn’t let it go in my first couple months down in South Carolina and I ended up punching some small white kid. Of course, my ego come in and tries to justify my actions with my virtue by saying, “I know that you’re against fighting people but sometimes people have it coming.” To this day, I do think that is true. But only 0.000000001% of the time. For the far majority of life, it behooves individuals to avoid conflict wherever possible. It hurts. There is a serious mental pain with saying fuck off to your ego. I understand it. I’ve been there. Changes don’t happen over night but this is something that you really have to work on. In the future, girls and guys are going to respond to you negatively. You don’t know the reason. Maybe a few of their family members recently passed away maybe they just broke up with someone that you are similar to. The bottom line is that if you see that shit is going awful, self-amuse and bounce. Make some kind of joke that makes you laugh, appeasing your ego and leave before anything can come of the situation. Today, I saw you stay way longer than needed. There was an antagonistic attitude existing there for at least 5 minutes before things turned physical. At any moment, you could have left and said, “Chi, I’ll see you upstairs. Good luck with her.” Instead, you attacked with your words. I’m sure I’ve made some girls cry one way or another in my day, but never like this. I firmly disagree with what took place and that is why I stayed. I stayed to remedy the situation. I stayed because is a roundabout way, it was my fault that this was taking place. If I had just gone home or if I would have hit on girls upstairs instead, none of these things would have taken place. I really do get your feelings towards women. Literally one moment, you’re in the clouds thinking this shit is easy and this girl is so sexy. I love women! This girl is kissing me and she has fantastic boobs and and ass and now I’m having sex! I love women! ->>> and the next moment you can’t catch a break with females and it seems like every girl you come in contact with is an extreme cunt with a will to piss you off. And not only that, she is a cunt who is getting a degree in communications or fashion who will most likely not amount to more than a trophy wife or a single unhappy career woman in her 30s looking for all of the guys that she passed over in her 20s.That is some super annoying shit. I think the same shit. I lift, I have a good face, I have a beard, I have 80k+ jobs lined up for when I graduate, I’ve traveled the world a bit, I read, I think etc etc. Why would these girls look over me? I’m the greatest? The reason is because females don’t think logically. Sure they have the ability to, but when it comes to men and a lot of the decisions in their lives, they operate solely on how they feel in the moment. This is a fact of reality. This is life. This is how the world is. There is nothing you or I can do to change it. Never never never will a girl look at your resume and decide to fuck you. Never will a girl look at your face and decide to fuck you (there are exceptions but you get the point). I know you already know these things but I don’t think that your subconscious, your mind’s mind, your heart knows these truths. Hatred of women comes from a misunderstanding of reality and a belief that they (women) should be different and are different in other places. I’ll confirm right now that there are cunts ins every culture and you will get rejected in every city you go to in the world. Anecdotally, I went out on probably 60-70% of the days in 2016 and I still only had sex with a random girl once every 1-2 months. Sure there were spurts where that was lowered to days but there were a couple periods where I could get nothing done. Unless you are a celebrity, this is the reality. Fucking girls of cold night or day approaches requires an immense volume of approaches to be successful and to get “good”. After 2-3 years of going out with the right attitude, a few years of refusing to be negative on the walk home at the end of the night, a few years of choosing to go over the good connections and what went well instead of what went poorly, a few years of qualifying girls instead of yourself or your friends, you might be “good”. Enjoy this. Don’t worry about other people. Worry about yourself. Seth is a great example of this. He is or seems to be happy doing what he is doing. He enjoys making fun of people. He drinks and has a good time when he is out. He doesn’t go out of his way to hit on girls because he doesn’t want to. To each his own. Seth is one of those guys, that when he chooses to be out here, he will succeed because I don’t see the negativity built up in him yet. Here I am, damaged goods myself, trying to give advice. I will repeat that I am saying these things to myself as much as I am to you. I’ve been in the same mindsets and the same places as you. I can show you some videos and game material that has helped me on the way. Search YouTube for RSDTyler and watch the last 4 videos. If you approve, watch more or ask me for more shit. He has a much deeper understanding and is able to explain game a lot better. Either way, even though I’m as fucked up or even more damaged than you, I have seen the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel many times as I’m sure you have. There are literally billions of women in the world. That is the one thing that was beaten into my brain in 2016. I traveled to 20+ cities in the US and abroad and met hundreds of girls. I have not even dented the population of the earth. I haven’t even dented the population of a small city lime Morgantown. There are so many thousands of girls on this planet that for you to get pissed off and argue with 1/3,000,000,000 is really just silly. You will never meet half, a quarter, or a tenth or one percent of a one percent of the women on the earth. Fascinating. Do your game, have your fun and live your life. Bros before hoes but I really do think you need to remember this lesson. It’s okay to let things go and it’s okay to take an L on interactions if you see you upside. I’ve fought against many currents in my day but for you, I think that the next step is learning when to jump ship."

do I have any intrinsic interests?,2019-09-02 21:39:00,"Short answer, no. I want to learn Russian so that I can communicate with more women and for the business opportunities that would open up in my favorite countries on earth. I want to learn game so that I can have more long-lasting relationships with humans of the opposite sex. I mean I have learned quite a bit of game but I want to continue for that reason. In fact, I'd go out on a limb and say that I have learned as much as I need to learn from online and book sources. At this point, personal coaching is the only thing that will get me better. Ha, no I actually disagree with that. I think that I could definitely add drilling of some sort to my life to get better at very specific things. Like getting through the chasm that opens up in the middle-ish point of the night when I see a wall and just want to quit. I felt that feeling the last time I was out. I was with Kyle, a guy I had met the previous night in DC. Kyle does not know that game and therefore is looking for significant direction and/or to coast off of the pussy that I am opening. That said, he does hold his own a bit. But having him there and telling him what should be done and have him prompt me to then do it, evoking an old fear. The fear of disappointing a student... the fear of losing some ego in front of someone I was teaching a new skill. It was weird. I've felt it before. It might be a new domain to conquer. The only times that I feel fear of approaching women is in the daytime and directly after telling someone what I would do in a specific situation and then being prompted to follow through. 1) daytime - approach more women in the daytime 2) explaining then showing - explicitly call something out, then do it Both are easier said than done and also extremely easy since they are both one step successes. I'm not bad at game and I'm not bad at speaking in the day.. I just need to do both of those more often if I want to be successful. That said, I have no interest in meeting more American girls and staying with them long term. everytime I embark on this thing, it takes a toll on my soul. I really do have to leave the country don't I. Fucking ridiculous. Ite on to the next. I want to learn to teach esl so that I can travel the world and make increasingly larger salaries while being in places that offer adventure and novelty puss. abort on this article as it is not longer interesting to me."
i might be making a big mistake,2020-02-25 06:36:00,"By moving towards this unknown of life knowing my past record with taking action, knowing my impatience with results, lord I could be making a really big mistake by leaving to go back to Moscow. Goddamn. I'm scared. This fear is going to be useful but still it doesn't feel real enough. I'm fucking around. I'm not doing the things that I need to do to get ready. Working at Sam's really killed the things that I was doing and here I am now, a dude that hasn't practiced russian or lifted a weight in a month. This is butthole. Jesus. What should I do. I will pursue my dreams but damn, understand that the things that you'll have to do to cross the bridge and get to the other side will push and break whatever zone of comfort you've set up for yourself. good luck. I don't care what you do for the rest of this week. either kill shit or veg out but when you get to new york, everything is going to change."
quick pip,2016-07-09 19:51:00,"pip - epiphany I found this while talking to myself in the woods today (yeah I'm weird). I am my own best therapist. Maybe I should get a real one though. Anyway, here it is. I don't want to fuck around with girls that I don't like. Ground breaking, I know. The epiphany part is where I found a dichotomy which is preventing me from having the relationships I want to have. I don't want to fuck around with girls that I don't like but I also don't want to fuck around with girls that I do like because those girls always find a reason to give me the boot and it hurts. It hurts no matter what my 'abundance' is or w=how I am looking at the situation. I can change my mindset and that is an awesome temporary fix but I really do need to find something real. It feels like I am wasting girls, which is against my beliefs. If there is something that I am fucking up then I really need to fix it before I fuck up any other relationships that I have from here on out. But there is almost no way to figure out my issue. I've wanted to videotape all of my interactions with girls but that is unreasonable but also difficult since I would probably have to hire someone. Any way that is it. The solution is to continue through the pain and try to establish my connection in spite of the world and my previous inability to create a connection. Can't catch them all. Life isn't pokemon."
quick post before studying & GE update,2017-05-05 08:52:00,"Hello mate, I tried another threesome tonight. I got closer... I did a three-way kiss and was able to kiss both girls. I used the line about using the bathroom in the girls' building. That is the sneaky way that I know of getting into a girl's place. I was able to get in but there was a public restroom in the building. The fuck??? Since when does an apartment have a public bathroom on every floor? Anyway, that failed. But tonight as a whole was a moderate success. I went until the final bell rung. I danced and danced and did many reps. I probably got a total of lllll,lllll --- so ten or so reps in the night. Not bad. I could have done more and faster. My issues are thus: 1) I see hot girls pretty early in the bar. I don't want to approach this early because I'm not ready and I feel like I'll be blowing my load too soon. I usually end up in dead ends early in the night. Not necessarily boots but situations that I can't lead anywhere. I guess those are ones where you get a number and split. The solution for the future is approach anyway and get the number if you can't lead. 2) The second sticking point is material. Say what I will about old school set routines, I find myself saying similar shit to girls every night and winging the kisses and leads. Tomorrow, after the separations test, I need to compile material into a few new routines, memorize, and practice them in the mirror. There are points where escalation should happen and I definitely could have made out with that five-foot tall girl. a. This sticking point needs to be split up because it is basically saying that I need to get better at game overall... no shit. Specifically, my opens are fine and my ability to insert myself into a conversation and get some laughter at something is good. I should work specifically on disqualification, negs, and Kino-escalation. b. Kino escalation from the dance floor. My dance game is phenomenal. The swing dance moves are powerful and I'm attractive and lit enough for a girl to decide to dance with me off the rip. I just need the next move. What is next? Get a name, number, pull outside, pull to the bar, etc. Come up with some next moves or Kino-escalate on the dance floor. Pause - I did get two girl numbers and maybe a couple guy numbers too, tonight. I doubt I will get fruit from them but I did what I did. Shoot shots early tomorrow. No reason to waste. Summary: work on material for disqualification, negs, and Kino-escalation with an emphasis on dance floor moves. Update call with Germal: I did a fantastic job. The plant is in the process of finalizing the engineering drawings for the noise panelling. Pump covers worked so well on line 10 and they didn’t burn up the pumps so the plant is moving forward with that."
Anger is Ego,2016-11-23 17:41:00,"All anger is ego. Anger is your ego's defense against being destroyed. Ego needs to feel the power and respect of all individuals. Ego is the rush to strike out when one of your subjects is disobedient (otherwise known as a nigga moment). You must ignore it. You must brush ego aside. Because although there is a time for everything, the old adage 'it is easier to catch bees with honey than vinegar' will always ring true. Despite what you feel in that moment, the show of emotions will lower people's opinion of you, no matter how just. Discipline if you mush but do it with a sound mind and body. If you need to walk away, walk away. Really though, you need to visualize the anger as quickly as possible, recognize it for what it is and banish it from your thoughts. Just like in Westworld, when the humanoids were interviewed by the humans and the humanoids started having an emotional moment, the human just motioned to shut off that part of the humanoid's functionality. You have that same control over your body. If the goal of Westworld was to make us question ourselves, our purpose, and the difference between us and these beings who look just like us but were created by us, they've succeeded. There is no difference as the creator stated in episode 7. Most of us are content to live life in our predetermined loops, repeating the same words, behaviors, and emotions. Most of us are content to do what we are told to do. We find comfort when a strongman or woman interrupts our predicaments with an unwavering solution thereby completely relieving us of the responsibility. We welcome the strong suggestion by our parents or peers to go toward one career, one job, one place to live or another. And while none of that is inherently wrong, Chi you must strive to be greater. This is not to say you can escape your evolutionary drives. This is not to say you can escape the past that made you into who you are and continually makes all of your decisions. This is not to say that you can rise above your elephant as Jonathan Haidt would say. This is in fact to say that you must strive to not dwell in comfort. Revel in the discomfort and absurdity of the world. Revel in rejection and marvel as to how it physically cripples other men while giving you soul-lifting life. Revel in the seeming randomness of choice and reasons for why people do certain things and not other things. Question the nature of your reality and realize that although finding out an answer to this question is by it's nature impossible, people still fight, steal, murder, and commit all crime in pursuit of the unanswerable. Life is absurd. Living and enjoying in spite of that fact and going against the perceived grain is your win."
politics,2017-03-14 22:03:00,"Liberals and parasitic mindsets. You have no personal responsibility. Healthcare is a right. Education is a right. But for some reason, Gucci is not a right. The new ugg boots aren't a right. A 2017 car isn't a right. Cover to get into a club isn't a right. A table at Marquee in New York isn't a right. But you still have all of these things??? How is this? Why is this? I figured it out. Or at least I heard it from Tommy Sotomayor and I am expanding it to more than just the group he was referencing. You pay for what you want and beg for what you need. You have no problem spending your money on all kinds of entertainment and fun shit, shit you don't need and the shit you really do need i.e. housing, transportation, healthcare, food should all be taken care of by someone else. Force the rich person to pay for the shit I need. Force the smart conservative to pay for the life that I have become accustomed to. And what kind of mindset does this remind you of? A child. A teenager. Some shit where you live in your parent's house and your mommy and daddy pay for everything and then you get to spend the money you got from your job for yourself! Isn't that cute? Well, guess what? The government isn't your mommy and daddy. I am not your mommy or daddy. If you want shit in the real world you have to work for it and if you aren't rich and want to stay alive you have to make sacrifices. You don't get to Netflix and chill. You don't get the newest Macbook, the newest iPhone, the newest car. You don't even get the oldest iPhone. You get a god damn flip phone because you don't have the money to afford the $60 dollar bill that comes with the iPhone. You can't afford that car payment because you have to buy healthcare and food and don't even fucking dare try to have a kid. If that kid dies that is on you and you should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law if you choose to have a kid and irresponsibly expect the whole world to pay for your mistake. College, healthcare, phones, abortions, haircuts, sex, clothes are not fucking rights because society isn't your goddamn parent and one day you will realise that. Every day that you pretend it is the closer our system gets to falling apart. 20 trillion dollars in debt and we are printing new dollar bills to cover our ass and you want the government to be your mommy and daddy? Go live in your parent's basement if you want healthcare, food, clothing, and Netflix to be your right. The real world will be waiting when you grow up."
I'm burned out,2021-06-09 18:21:00,"after a week or a couple weeks of shit, i'm burned. taking it easy. i'll get back into things slowly again. just trying not to drop everything. keeping russian and stretching. not sure about the working out and the dancing. i'll figure it out. had a moment yesterday. i think i still have guilt and shame from mary and the fact that i won't be able to speak to her again makes it strange that there is no possible remedying the situation. sucks. makes me feel bad. I'm going to go through those chapters of letting go later and try to get into that. I also possibley could do jui jitsu thursday or wednesday so that might be fun or it might be something."
Field report - Date with Emma the Criminology Student,2019-09-22 02:18:00,"I was bouncing at a club/bar called The Bank when I saw this guy... he had a decent vibe, decent dance moves, and good looks but he wasn’t approaching any girls. He would come close but then would end up dancing around the girls instead of with them. I grabbed him and pulled him to the side. I said, “Dude you are killing it. You will get laid tonight if you just lightly take a girls hand and spin her. Touch her hand, allow her to see that you are attractive and having fun, then start dancing with her. Here let me show you.” And then I reached for the nearest girl, pulled her in and started dancing with her. Haha this is one of my favorite things to do while out... Some guys end up learning and others just gasp in wonder but either way I’m entertained. Anyway, she asked if I was even allowed to do this since I was a bouncer. I said I don’t know but I just couldn’t let her pass by. I danced with her for a sec then started teasing her a lot about her white dance moves and challenging her to see if she could drop it low, twerk etc. She hooked immediately. We flirted back and forth for the next 30m-1h. NOTE: I used a marriage plot line at the beginning... I number closed and soon after, because one of her friends got into a fight, she left. She texted me after how to pronounce my name. I answered and we went back and forth. For a bit. Then around 5, she responded to my most recent message. I faceted her and tested the waters to see if I could come over for some early morning / late night shenanigans. She said nah so I settled for meeting the next morning for coffee. Was a bit late but the date went mostly well. Almost veered into politics a bit from her part... She was commenting on the environmental destruction of the world and how she thought America was a shit country. I ignored this stuff, found a spot where we agreed and moved on. We went on a walk after coffee. Unfortunately, the area that I wanted to go was unattractive because most of it was under construction. No biggie. We kissed and walked back to my car. I gave her several stories from my life since I had many memories around the college campus. It went fine but in hindsight, I did a lot of the talking. When we got back to my car, I asked he to tell me a story from her hometown. She told me something about some drama she had with a girl for two summers in a row. Though she says she hates the drama, I could see she enjoyed telling this story. I tried to set up a meetup later... she didn’t really bite and said she had homework and a friends birthday party after... she probably wouldn’t make it downtown. I was disappointed. We kissed hard one more time and I let her go. Note: she was the one that stopped that last kiss first. ---Summary Things I did well • My vibe while meeting was crazy sexual - MY INNUENDO GAME IS BACK BABY • This date and talking with her was so fun because of all the innuendo and misinterpretation that we were both doing • Kept the energy high during most of the date Things I could work on • Beginning speaking parts of the date were very boring and didn’t really contribute to what I was trying to build. • Maybe I could come up with topics that I care about before hand? • I’m killing sexual tension that I can create though physical touch by spiking into a random topic of conversation immediately after • Option: use moments after kissing to lower your voice and get more intimate with the girl... ask and speak about things that will bring you closer and keep her mind in an emotional state • Find ways to get her to engage more on the front end - be very careful not to dominate the conversation... I like that you are being more open and vulnerable by telling these stories but keep in mind your goals here • Don’t forget to seed the post date pull - you forgot to get logistics and as a result, you were at the mercy of whatever she wanted to make up there after • Send that post date text - you sent one here but it was something asking about how her homework was going. You used to send better ones - I suggest commenting on how much you liked the date"
ok,2023-02-07 11:15:00,"mani don't even know what to write here anymore. everything is played. all that is left is action or death. that's literally it. I have to make these rompers in the next six to eight hours or die. I have to finish these jean jackets today. I am in a new cycle that is completely unsustainable. namely, buy fabric, buy patterns, look at them collecting dust while the list of things I want to try continues to back up.Im tired though. and even that idea is played out. I don't care about what i want, i only care about how I can even change to do things. that's allso now my life is completely in my own hands again. completely and totally. I have to really strive. i really am at a level where tomorrow everything could be gone or tomorrow I could be a famous millionaire. lol well maybe not that extreme but you get the point.and I realize the extent to which it's always been that way. the pressure is pressuring though. I hate it and at the same time, I've prayed for it for a long time. How many times have I wished for a personal pressure to be great. It still feels different than the pressure to be great for someone else but for the first time, I feel a tingling in my loins for myself. Generally, my opinion of myself isn't very high. as much as I pretend, it's actually rock bottom... mainly because I know what I could be doing and I know what I am doing. relatively, I'm doing well, but to myself, god I'm playing mad games. but ok. i know what i need to do to be great. 1) change the inputs- you are what you eat and if all you consume is political or religious nonsense, no matter how entertaining, that's what you are. If you want to be a designer, dancer, charismatic pua, leader of men and women, you have to consume content in that direction and then you have to take action in that direction. right now your content is confusing... it looks like you want to become a debater or a pro atheist or some shit.2) set some basic goals- i think right now you are swimming in a quagmire of potential and without some level of direction, that's where you will stay. Pick some shit and move towards it. I want to learn russian and I want to be a better patternmaker. if those are my goals, then practicing skills in those directions are what need to be happening. patternmaker skills- improve welt pockets, waistbands, collars- learn womens wearRussian- just do it lol3) set a weekly buildout plan- i did it once before. the slow build towards that which I wanted. it worked. I need to do it again. basic weightlifting, basic content, basic study, basic salesI hate this but truly one of the things that pushes me or reminds me of what the actual fuck i'm doing is writing this shit out over and over and then going and doing that which i said I was going to do. here goes nothing"
the instagram thing is real,2018-10-21 20:26:00,"The bs that EV and Owen and Maze have been talking about instagram is so legit that I don't know what to say. Damn. 4 replies to my stories in 2 days from females I haven't talked to in months. This is groundbreaking and amazing. I may never get a number again. This is the opposite of needy. This is where you sit back and allow these women to engage you. Literally, amazing. holy shit. I'm cool."
"Game, alcohol, a crying girl and her friends",2017-01-02 12:21:00,"I am so proud and disappointed in myself from last night. I have once again proved how easy it can be to pickup women. I do see a blockage. Sometimes at the beginning of the night, girls need to be opened first but they are still not fully capable of having fun and being lit. You can come up and only pump their state so much before even they begin to feel incongruent and uncomfortable. You can leave and then come back with more game but that margination time is essential to work correctly. Other girls are lit and you can kiss them in 12 minutes if you stay in and build the right amount of value. Hit them with the comfort right after to persuade her that she is not a hoe *you’re not directly saying this of course) and then continue. I find that I always get some resistance at some point via a shit test to see whether I can handle the girl. I don’t remember the first girl’s shit test but the one in the club went a little like this. I think I grabbed her pussy and made a trump reference. I don’t remember if I did both. She immediately started saying no and pushing my hands away complaining about the whole trump v Hillary just like any common virtue signaling American girl. Her words were almost exactly, “I like this but if you voted for trump I’m out.” Me, I did not vote but if I did it would have been for trump. But if you are smart you see the amount of value you would lose even if it is a polarizing statement and conversation to have. You are playing with fire and although I have come back from similar shit in the past, the amount of explaining you have to do just isn’t worth it. I have no clue what I even told her. I think I ignored it and started talking about how her shirt reminded me of the guy in the bible with the colorful shirt whose brothers were all jealous of him. She got the reference and even named the character (I don’t remember which one though haha). Usually I can’t identify shit tests infield and deal with them as is but this one was so clear it was fun to combat. Now, I will be honest and say that I have so far become this person that I am that in that exact moment I was just acting how I normally would. It is good to know that I am now I guy who can naturally take on shit tests. Congratulations on the badge mon bon monsieur. Although, I kissed at least 3 girls last night, I still lost my phone. The location services are on but I’m getting frustrated because the wi-fi in my Airbnb is currently not supplying me. I will say that normally my crying girl game is A*. In the case of the girl with the colorful shirt, her friend walked over and threw a nuclear warhead into the conversation with a ‘my current boyfriend just dumped me’ shtick. It was painful to see the girl I was with just walk away. I reached for my phone to get her number and… nothing. I was so confused, even slightly embarrassed and so I walked away and searched the club for my phone. As punishment though, since I did not find it and since the irresponsibility present there is so massive, I went home soon after. I do realize though what I really hate most about game: meeting awesome girls and never ever seeing them again. Loving on a girl and then having her disappear in the ether. It is emotionally traumatizing for me though to be honest, I could ignore those feelings. But then I just wouldn’t be alive."
28,2017-05-07 16:23:00,"There’s something about seeing a girl that I was head over heels for in the past. That is the thing that I dislike about Morgantown… I see the loves of my life all the time and am therefore constantly reminded of my inadequacy in the eyes of girls that I actually care about. There is no friendzone for me anymore. There is either like or dislike. There is either like or fade away to black, forever destined to fake hugs and hellos when ran into. I saw Leah today. She came over and talked to me and Dustin for a little bit. I’m not sure what would have happened if Dustin wasn’t there. I felt her liking me and then it was lost. Why does it always get lost? It gets lost when I get weird. It gets lost when I think for a second that I have a change with a girl that I actually like. It hurts. I get so weird and I feel bad for her. I feel bad that she has to suffer through the ordeal and wish it to end quickly so I can end her pain in her experience with me. Knoxville will be interesting. New start part 5. Part 1 was going to college and I learned that I can handle routine and discipline. Part 2 was Baltimore and I learned that I can handle the heat and that I am an attractive fun person to be around when I want to be. Part 3 was Cincinnati where I discovered again that I am a human capable of having kryptonite feelings for a girl. Even after so much growth, a girl still has the power to strike genuine fear and doubt in my heart. I also learned intent and how to channel it without words. Part 4 was Charleston where I learned I have control over my emotional state at all times and that if I am feeling bad, I can change it. I really learned that if I don’t like a person, I don’t want to be around them. Part 5 was Greenville, one of the most important parts so far. I learned swing dance which is the most powerful power move I have learned to date. Here I started settling and settling hard. Pussy is pussy and a hole is a hole. Fucking girls raw is an extremely unhealthy habit and hard to break. I am at 28 now with the sex I had last night and this morning with a girl that was in my philosophy of sex and gender class. Quick story I was in the bar with my friends Paul, Paul’s indian friend and Nima. Nima was with his boss Kernel and I was trying to get him to pull up and talk to girls. Nima is high in neuroticism and there fore gets up set and worried very quickly. It was hard for him to get started talking to girls and as always, that puts a damper on everything around him. I see that damper on a lot of the middle eastern guys that end up in the bars. Scary. That shit is a recipe for terrorist attacks and mass shootings. Anyway, I am demonstrating to Paul how to pull up and talk to girls. Paul’s only issue is that he lacks the confidence to put himself on the line in the bar. I demonstrated on this cute blonde girl and then left her. In hindsight, she was extremely cute and had a wonderful smile. I should have stayed. She was very pretty. Pretty enough for me to actually like her. Skip skip skip and I lead Paul to the bar and open the girl on the other side of him. As he takes over the conversation, I step back and watch the magic. Paul is a magician, he just needs someone to drive him to the show. I slid in a couple times when I saw him faulter but, for the most part, he held his own. Then, this girl pulls up on me. I have no clue who she is but I always play along until I can figure out what I going on. She is dancing and grinding up on me with her leather pants. In the moment, I was for sure that she had me mistaken for another black person and since she didn’t see the error of her ways, I took advantage. I tried to pull for a second and when I saw a slight bit of resistance, I pulled back and made a quick recalibration to deal with this LMR. I started looking around the bar saying something like, “If you don’t want to go home with me or if you don’t think you could handle the full thing, I need to find another girl who will. In fact, that girl over there is kinda cute. Shit, I would go over there right now except I don’t think she could handle the full thing…” and my then she was giggling up a strorm and insisting the she could in fact handle the full dick. Once tricked, you pull."
the building stage,2018-11-26 04:23:00,"She was a tease. She has always been a tease. From the day I met her, Emily Collins has played with my life strings and made me feel like she could be the one or a the one. But I've never smashed. She knows very well what she would be to me and that is a reason why she persists. I'm not a beta... at least not around her... I've done everything that I could have done barring literally hitting on other girls in front of her. It will just have to be a life thing of mine to fuck. I don't mind that as a random one off side project. I have a few of those that I hold on to. Actually, she might be the last one. and I might use this as the time where I back off barring her contacting me for quoitus.Lest we not forget that it is inherently a needy thing to go our and drive 5 hours to go see a girl regardless if it is on the way home to boston or not. you still went out of your way to see her (power imbalance), you talked to her in roundabout way about game (bad game), you didn't adequately destroy that shit tests of whether or not you were a hoe (bad game). So you don't deserve her.On to the bigger thing here. I have been playing with the thought for awhile. Can I make it bigger asa person, can I develop the amount of clout necessary to fuck a girl without really trying? That is what I want and that is what I am chasing. The ability to walk over or start talking to a random girl and get her after she sees the snapshots of the life I'm living. The whole cold-approach thing is starting to get old. At some point, you have to start building to something greater. You can use a platform, you can use cold approach with a combination of social circle game which is just short for making friends and keeping them (there doesn't need to be a word for experiencing the results of a few months of cold approach). But the point is you have to build. Else you risk a kind of pseudo nope limbo that engulfs you and make you part of some crowd that searching and following something. I really haven’t expressed myself on here as much as IVe wanted to in the past few months. There’s been a feeling holding me back. Like I want to writie better or produce the content in a different way. But I really need this level of letting loose on the computer. Releasing all the pent up frustration or winning feeling is necessary in a world where most of the interactions thatI’ve been having g are on the less legitimate side.I went out in morgantown for the first time in a6 months. It showed my how much I’ve grown and how much I’ve stayed the same. There was still the dynamic with specific people where they are socially excited to see you or talk about seeing you but that idea is what was important to them, and finally seeing you was wholly unimportant and the quickly move on from you existence. It was a thing in high school and it was a thing with Katie in DSP and Jarett, and Jarett’s dad, and the twins, and Nathan. The only legitimate interactions that I felt were meaningful or at least something happened were with Seth (mostly because he was there and always took time to engage), Nick (at first at least for the same reason, though by the end he was acting for more reactions out of others which got annoying), and dustin (who I always talk with about the same topics but he’s my oldest friend so it was cool), my brother (who I don’t get to talk to for extended durations and it was nice to stand in the cold in the line at Best Buy to connect over girls, tattoos, music, podcasts, etc.). I added so many ands and used bad grammar because I was remembering people after I though I had completed each list haha. It was a good weekend altogether. I am at least as lit as I used to be and I think I’ve slightly progresses in the energy management sphere. In the past I would have most likely died in Joes, but this time I thrived. The difference now is the same as the difference between all of my good and bad nights... I gamed everyone. I had at least 5-8 interactions before making it to the creme del al that joes ended up being. The best and worst one was the girl in apothecary.She was very interesting and had been eyeing me fro the time I walked in. I could tell that she wanted something from me so I decided to engage. We talked for a long time with me pretending or legitimately caring about her degree in cyber security. It worked as an interaction for awhile. She hat short brown hair cut in a bob style with eccentric glasses, maroon lipstick with the shirt and shoes to match, completed with denim jeans. She was slightly uncomfortable in general and I think that she was unused to conversations like the one that were having so I decided to make it easier on her by limiting the amount of silences therein. I engaged in a bit of kino here and there to emphasize a point and she didn’t draw away so I assumed it was going pretty well. Then, either she mentioned that she had plans with the bartended after or I introduced her to my friends (Seth, dustin, and nick). Then I introduced her with the guys, somehow immediately, nick mentions something kinda racist like he is the token black in the group and told the girl not to worry because he supported trump. Bothe of those things set the girl off and the interaction went very downhill from there.As with every downhill interaction, if I see it failing, I will push it further down the hill, Tripp it, bring it back up, and kick it further to make it happen faster in order to entertain myself. I launched into a hypothetical diatribe about how our relationship in the future would go.. something like we would be married for 5-8 years before things would start failing and she’d cheat first then I’d marry a girl 20 years my junior etc. She did not like this at all and it was fun. I ended the infection with a clinking of our glasses. The type of rejection at the beginning of the night really sets the tone to not care as much for the rest of the night. I generally am concerned with what people think of me but after that I was loose enough to interact.I ended up kissing at least two more girls in the night, one in joes, Sierra hunly and Eric Nates ex’s friend, and the there outside of lotsa most where I pulled some wild notes out and entertained some niggas that were observing from the window. Solid night altogether. I’d say there were 5 sets that I didn’t shoot on that in hindsight would have been good practice. Solid night back in morgantown all together. Nathan gave some feedback where he stated that my game is generally either take it or leave it where he used to calibrate to the girl. I would generally agree though I would say that neither he nor anyone else truly knows what I talk or care about and as a result they can’t fathom what I’m holding in when I hear some absurd shit or what’s I’m forcibly connecting with because I see value there. I calibrate a lot but the calibration curve may not be adjusted for the demographic that I’m dealing with... or it may not be capable of the wide range that it needs to be to get most girls."
My speech to the kids next week,2017-08-10 21:03:00,"Confidence is the quickness with which you can move from thought to action. We are applying this to girls here but this is really a life lesson. Game is: calibrated intent intent + freedom from outcome when in doubt, whip it out back it off, and chill You are a pussy. You are a not a nice guy. You are a guy that does not know how to effectively communicate his intentions with women. This can come from a lot of places. For some of you, it was one really bad rejection in middle school that has stuck with you to this day. Others it's a deeper self-esteem issue that was developed in childhood. No matter what it is, I am here to help. There are two types of game. Inner and outer. Outer game is the stuff that we will be tweaking while out in the field. Body language, what to say, sexual innuendo are examples of outer game. Inner game is the mentality you have while going out. It is much deeper than outer game and the fundamental change that you will undergo in order to become good at this and good at life is the real goal of this path if you should choose to take it. Tonight, we will work on taking action using what I call the 3 second and 30 second rules. 3-second rule states that if you see a girl that you like or think that you might like, you have 3 seconds to go talk to her. Not, ""I need to get another drink from the bar first."" Not, ""let me work up the courage."" We are going to be taking action. I will be in there with you. I'll open the first few sets and after I do 2-3, I'll have each of you give it a try. Remember this one thing, if you approached, you win. That is the frame with with I want you to view tonight. Never measure your success with women based on the attractiveness or quantity. The only thing that you can control is you. For now, the benchmarking will be on how many approaches you can get in a night and how long you can make those interactions last. I'm not going to give you any lines, plays, or gimics. This is raw shit. Jump in the pool and see if you can swim. If you can't handle the cold approach, I'm wasting my time."
I feel bad at the moment,2019-04-16 17:21:00,there are levels to this shit. I feel like an imposter because the person that I portray myself to be isn't who I am a lot of the time. I feel like I have no game and I can't get girls I am a slave to political news and podcasts and I can't stop myself from partaking in them I have a lot of angst because I am thinking of turning down a job that is a good opportunity that could theoretically set me up for a life remotely in 3 years I feel angst about turning down the interview and thus putting out bad energy on my friend who put my application in the running in the first place I feel worthless because I can't get my ideas or shirts sold out in the world and though I get compliments people still aren't purchasing I feel anger for my job because today I just don't want to do shit and people are bothering me and there is no help on how to figure this shit out because I was given a different type of project than that which I was trained on I am scared because my future looks murky and weird I have a shit ton of debt my car just started fucking up and the mirror is currently broken.
the barren - why I have periods of no pussy,2019-09-01 01:37:00,"Stress and fear. The only semester of no sex since I started fucking back in 2015 was the fall of 2017 where I underwent a significant amount of turmoil and stress trying to make i through the beginning of my last semester in college. I didn't know whether I was going to be able to graduate or not and as a result my sex life took a gigantic hit. Couple that with my sexual market value on college campuses (I'm a 5) and the level of rejection I get when I'm there, I took a big hit that semester. I experienced something very similar here recently though I am very different now than I was then. I had turmoil in my life while partying most weekends. The difference between Summer 2019 and Fall 2017 was that Summer 2019 was not for lack of trying. I probably fumbled 6-7 pussys in this time period. Somewhere because I didn't have a place to take the girl, Others were because I didn't escalate properly. Fumbles include (1) girl on my last night of phoenix... had her ready to go but didn't have a place to take her... that extra time prompted her to text one of her other hookups and dip. (2) didn't get into the car with brogan at the end of out night of wildness (3) didn't escalate or lead in philly with that mini ghetto girl that was down (4) didn't get into the car with the philly girl that i made out with in the basement club for 5 minutes at the end of the night (4) didn't get into the uber in seaport boston with random girl after the gryffin concert (5) didn't escalate on the girl that lucas brought home in boston Suffice to say: emotional turmoil and fear of the future are primary reasons for when I'm comfortable approaching."
haha okay wow so you're giving her dreams of my cheating now???,2021-01-11 12:33:00,"so i banged a couple girls in the last two weeks... I know I have a girlfriend, i'm a bad person. one old girl and one young girl. and guess what the fuck mary said today. i had a dream that you cheated on me with one old girl and one young girl. wow. okay I don't believe in shit but now i do. I have to get out of this marriage thing that we are doing before it's too late or I have to convert it to a friendly thing and continue from a roommate / cool with each other standpoint. God, you really do work in mysterious ways. God, or ghosts or whoever is doing this. And it wasn't some passive aggressive shit like she was telling me what she knew... i mean it could have been but she really can't hide her emotions about stuff like this. sure there were a couple chances for her to see my messages in my phone and assume shit or just directly understand what's happening. there are reciepts.. namely me getting the addresses of one old girl and one youjng girl in the IG dms. I will delete them today but goddamn how the fuck is this a thing."
a night with jack - a night feeling normal,2019-08-12 00:04:00,"I went out with my old friend jack promell. we connected at a random cooking class back 3-4 years ago and have been good friends ever since. He's a chill go with the flow kinda dude. I could tell while we were out that he wasn't completely comfortable in this sphere but that he was willing to try because he knew that this was the type of thing that I enjoyed. Pretty early on I attracted 2-3 different girls that I could have stayed with. One had a giant booty but she seemed a bit drunk and she had a bit of a tummy and I honestly thought that I could get better. Silly me. Idk man. Like theoretically I should be able to get these much hotter girls but there seems to be some sort of artificial glass ceiling created by something that I am doing and I have no clue what it is. Some girls, it is obvious why they get unattracted... my self-amusement goes into the world of being completely unrelatable and meaning that I come off creepy, weird, or crazy, none of which are characteristics of someone that you want to sleep with. The other thing is that I don't know, I think I'm denying myself the pleasures of sweet sex that I would enjoy for the possible opportunity to become better. I unconsciously don't want to fuck another girl and not be proud of what I've done. I want to be able to at the very least be proud of my conquest and preferable like spending time with the person in question. That whole package though has proved tougher than not. I'm proud of the amount of action that I took last night. I quit pretty hard after jack left though and ended up sleeping on a bench in a park for an hour or so before I got an uber and went back to my car where I had the best sleep I've had in awhile. The weather was slightly chilly and it felt so amazing to get wrapped in that blanket after a full night of partying and gaming. Before I got to the uber though, a car pulled up and an indian looking woman called over to me. She asked me is I was alright and asked if I wanted to fuck. I was like idk I mean I would... she asked how much money I had and I was like none... she pressured me for $100 and I was like nah I ain't got that. then she asked how big my dick was and asked me to come to her side of the vehicle so that she could feel it. I complied. While touching my dick, she informed me that she was a transgender. I was like oh. Then she said she'd fuck me anyway and told me to get in the passenger seat while I was waiting for the uber. I did as she said. she took the dick out and started putting lube into her pants down the back... that's when I saw the uber behind and dipped. Wow. Why the fuck was I literally considering fucking a random stranger trans with no condom in freaky ass DC? I don't know. I wasn't going to follow through with it but at the same time, a big part of me kinda sees myself as that level of garbage. I feel like garbage a lot when I am laying in my car with my feet up on the steering wheel watching the bachelor of the office while eating candy while it's humid as fuck causing me to lay in my own sweat. I feel like garbage. And when you feel like garbage, you act like garbage and fuck it maybe that comes out in sub communication somewhere. I just don't know what I need to change in order to get an attractive girl in America. Or anywhere for that matter. Let's be honest, I wasn't exactly banging out every girl in poland and russia. I had a fun night though. lots of approaches. lots of what felt like stand up."
41 - cleo he hair dresser with the pretty face,2018-10-01 15:27:00,"Hit 41 this weekend with this hairdresser girl who I met at the catering company that I dabble in every once in awhile. She had a deep pussy which was a welcome relief to the trash small shit that I was dealing with on 40. The ordeal was kinda weird in that while we were fucking she would make sounds or make expressions that made me feel like she was self conscious or wasn't enjoying it. There really was no foreplay or wind up to the drop. The whole thing was just her pulling off her pants and us fucking. I don't think I liked that as much. I kinda like the whole wind up and the bullshit and working the pants off and working the shirt off, etc. She had a big insecurity about men being gay because apparently she dated a gay man and then her father turned out to be gay and spring it on her mother. She was asking if I was gay based on my dress and the way I generally act. This is a pretty annoying question because if someone is asking if you are gay they have a big ass Yes plastered in the center of their mind and any answer that you give other than that big yes will just leave them dissatisfied until they walk in on you sucking your roommates dick after the ball game. Which hasn't and won't happen, I just wanted to indulge in a little joke. Which brings me to the other part where she was offended or upset at a joke that I made while the pants were off. I don't even remember exactly what was said but it was by no means offensive Still though, it lead to a reaction that I had to ignore until it went away . I know better than to engage directly in that shit test unless specifically forced to acknowledge it's existence and in the case where I acknowledged it, I dismiss it in as few words as possible. It is interesting that recently, for the past few women, I've gotten the comment that I am extremely attractive at some point in the sexual process. This is not something that I am used to but it is something that I am starting to accept as a new reality. The real question is figuring out what this is going to entail for my interactions going forward. I have always behaved like a 10 but it is only now that I am getting reactions like the 10 I am. There is an aloofness and a way about behaving that I could start to practice. One of the things that I have kept doing is dancing. I love dancing . But to thins point it is something that only lower value men engage in in order to get the attention of the females around them. Dancing is on par with buying girls drinks and complimenting them. It is a shortcut that can lead to a handicap at higher levels which I am starting to see now. I am almost in my mid to late 20s so I think it is time to start the curve to aloof coolery. I had fun though. I really did have fun with her and I had a lot of fun at that wedding in the cape. Most men recognize the threat I pose to stealing their lovely wives... Don't know why I wrote that sentence but there it is. To be honest if there is any time I believe in the idea of true love and marriage, it is at weddings where everyone dresses up and trots out their significant other and dances and enjoys the time with that person. We see the old couples who made it to the other side and we see the young love that just started their journey. the whole space in the middle is what people get scared of and there is great reason for that. This last weekend was also the first time that I seriously considered giving up the apartment to a point where I was thinking about walking off the beach in cape cod to call my roommate and tell him to start looking for another person. It was a serious moment of weakness and I realize that that is the kind of shit that I need to fight through. It is not something that anyone can help me with. This is something that I have to reason through ans stay steadfast in the commitment that I made to this man. I will be staying in this apartment for the duration of the lease. I Ubered for the first time in a long time on Friday. It was nice. The random wholesome and sometimes meaningful conversations that you have with passengers gives me hope in the general future of the world and of my life. I met a 51 year old dude that was getting married for the first time after a life of debauchery and fun and It showed me that there really is no hurry as far as all this shit goes. I don't think I want to wait that long if it was something that was actually on the table but still it was a new lifestyle choice that I did not know was still being made. I think I will try to Uber toward a goal of 500 per week to supplement the loss into rent and the future trip to Russia that I will be making in the winter."
Same Chi Same Morgantown,2017-01-15 06:34:00,"899% drake hours right now. I am over sitting in Marvin's room like I've been for the past 8-10 years. I got a flash of the past when I saw one of m old crushes from high school, Spencer Pritchard. She's fucking one of my best friends right now. And I am home. This is life. I don't want to do this. The game gives but I really can't stand it when it takes away. I am addicted of naked bitches and talking about girls that I almost had. Marvin's room is actually life. That is how I am living with some exceptions but really this is it. Like I haven't had sex 4 times this week. Do I want to though? That is really the question. I know how to close these girls. I know all the steps I have to take and the amount of tries I have to put in before I get any results. The thing is I really just don't want to. I don't' want to talk to any more girls. Tonight I am burnt the fuck out. Seeing the girl of my dreams' dreams and having her tell me more about how I was her first black crush just crushed my soul. Normal guys would take that shit as a compliment and run to the bank. I'm just hurt. I did kiss one girl tonight. I don't know her name. That is life. I kiss someone and then they leave. I kiss someone else and they leave. Rinse and repeat a number of times and then one of those girls I end up having sex with. But then she is dry or it is bad sex and I don't get to finish because I really don't know what the fuck I am doing there. Damn man. I am really in here in my feelings. I don't know what to do with my life. I don't want to go out anymore. I want to quit. I want to study every day and split up the time I am not studying with movies and TV shows. This sit about sex and girls is just way too much for my brain to process. The act of getting out of logical mind into my emotional pants is so much. The activation energy increases every time I go out, every time I get a number and nothing happens, every time I kiss and don't get a text back, every time I dance and don't have sex. I want to give up. Same album though, we'll be fine. Take a shot for me. I am done. I don't know for how long but I am done. I may come out of retirement for Cancun and spring break but there really are no promises. I don't want to do this shit anymore. I want a nice comfort shell to come back to every time I am rejected. I want pats on the back, laughs, and fun w hen I walk back to my guys. I don't want to continue out here alone for long. Hey Chi... That is the only option. You can't go out here with anyone else. You are out here alone. never ever ever ever ever forget that shit. There is no help. I repeat, sir there is no help. There is no wingman. There is only Chi. there is only you. YOu are the only one in charge of your destiny. If you haven't lwarned that by now then there is no chance. But since I am the one writing this, of course I know the state of the game and what to do and where I'm at. I don't need anymore help. I just need to recognize bad nights and reps more often. hey though fuck reps. I'm taking a sabbatical. Till March, I have to go home at 10. Bye. Tonight I took an L and in March I'll bounce back..."
33 + 34 - just trying to graduate,2018-03-20 18:30:00,"Right before spring break I went to a strip club with a random guy who I met during a lyft ride. He spent money on me and I met a stripper there. Very nice girl and I ended up meeting her the next day for coffee and then sex. I fucked her without a condom which was extremely degenerate of me but at the same time she only has my snapchat. I could ghost that shit in a second if need be though idk that would be immoral as fuck. (nicole w) Anyway, when I got back from New Orleans I closed some girl that I had been casually charring with for the last month. I don't know what it was the caused her ti finally pull the trigger and get with me but it happened. She had a fantastic ass but her kissing was trash. I don't like tongue or at lease as much as these women use it and she was kinda hurting my neck and lip with her pseudo-sexy biting. Other than that, I realize for the billionth time that I am really really out here for the chase and for the experience. (faith) I really do enjoy spending time with certain people and I feel a level of loss when I don't get to hang out with a girl in the future. The joy of finding out more about a person is amazing. Hanging out with them and finding out things that you both like to do and have in common is amazing. I am saddened increasingly by the loss of that more than I am at the loss of sex. As I am getting older I feel that I get more value and feel better when I create the opportunity for other horses to drink the water of the juice of random women more than when I actually get the opportunity myself. I increasingly find myself unwilling or disinterested by the sight of a new pretty girl. There are a couple girls (maddie davis) who I think sex with would be especially special and noteworthy but that is a special place of loving that I really don't get often when I am talking to women. Even Cassidy was seemingly an anomaly. I need to review my posts on her but as of now, I have no clue why she was one of my special ones. Was it because of her life nievite? was it because of her smile or her laugh? Was it because of her aspirations and drive? Was it because she was unavailable to me and then became available? Was it because of her skinny girl confidence? I liked that girl a lot dammit. And I don't like either of these new ones even remotely as much. Both would drop everything to be with me. I like that and appreciate that level of lust, adoration, or devotion. I just won't or can't feel the same thing in their direction. I am loling that I was thinking of taking one of them to meet my mother for my sister's track meet. I don't think either are worthy but should I do it just for the experience of taking a girl home? I don't know. I think not but I have a whole week to decide. I am scared of not graduating but apparently not scared enough to actually change my behavior to help my cause. I need to work harder in this week than ever in my whole life. I don't know how I will do it and I don't see a win here but, fuck it. All you can do is try."

rape pt 2,2015-12-22 20:06:00,"Not sure if there is a rape part 1 but here are some additional thoughts on rape. Women and feminists always say that it is a distinct fear of most women that they will be raped by a man they go on a date with or that a man will jump out of the bushes and rape them. But even by their own admission, a large percentage of rapes are perpetrated where the victim knows the rapist. Also, violent crime has been falling for the past 50 years so at this point in history it is an irrational fear to think that your life is in danger at every moment. And honestly I think that you're exaggerating or maybe just outright lying about your 'fear' to go outside. If you look at the numbers, men are more likely to undergo every single violent crime (including rape because of prison populations). EVERY SINGLE VIOLENT CRIME IS MORE LIKELY TO BE DONE TO A MAN THAN A WOMEN. Even with that being said, I am not afraid to go out in public. I have been going out to drink an party for 4 years now and I have never had a physical altercation with a man or a woman. I have been drinking in Baltimore right after their race riots, I went drinking in New York, West Virginia University (#1 Party School at the time) and I have never had a physical altercation. Maybe it was because of my skin color or the way I dressed or how I act or how I come across to people and police or, most likely, a combination of the lot. But the bottom line is, for the most part, if you don't want to be in a physical altercation with other individuals or police, don't put yourself in that situation and these things won't happen (for the most part. I understand serial killers, stranger rapists, and profiled police assaults can exist and happen but they are the exception not the rule). So really what all these feminists are saying is that women are weaker willed than men otherwise they wouldn't have the irrational fear of being attacked in broad daylight or while walking alone at night. The same way I don't go to certain areas alone because my chance of being assaulted increases (several places in New York and Baltimore), women should not go to certain areas where there chance of being attacked increases. Same for women as for men. If I go to a frat house, I risk being assaulted by frat douchebags if I become too drunk, hit on someones girl, or run into someone on a bad night. Women have the same risks although replace assault with sexual assault even though with frat guys I might have to worry about that as well. Bottom line is that we all could be irrationally afraid to go out in public and interact with others but we do have to remember that that fear is irrational most of the time and that there are many steps that we could take to protect ourselves if this is a fear that we truly have. Carry a gun, mace, stun gun, taser, bring friends, lift weights, 911 on speed dial, don't go to certain areas, don't wear certain things (I can't run from another man if I am barefoot or in flip flops), don't do certain things (get too drunk at certain places for example), etc, etc, etc. I could honestly make a couple page post on shit that you could do to mitigate your risks. Therefore, for the reasons outlined above, this is not a valid objection to bring to me for any reason in relation to any topic if you are a woman or a feminist. It is not a reason not to treat rape claims with skepticism (just as you would with any crime). It is not a reason to make laws that benefit only women and discriminate against the due process of men. I will"

Unified Theory: Try #1,2015-11-08 00:29:00,"What do I want to be? What do I have to be to get the women of this earth? These emotionally driven creatures. That question has plagued me for the past several months but I think I'm going to take my first crack at cracking the whole thing wide open. First, I now realize that there is a little bit of truth behind every romantic comedy and bullshit piece of advice you've ever gotten from someone trying to help you out in this context. 'Just be yourself' they will say, or 'just ignore girls. be mysterious and brooding'. 'Girls only like assholes', ' Girls only want to settle down with the nice guy', 'Girls just wanna have fun'. Step 1. Approach You've got to get real world experience with women first off. This is something that I've always had a hard time doing but the number one thing that I changed that got me success was my confidence. If you are sure of yourself, then every woman, man, and child will be sure of you as well. Another thing that helped me with this step, is not caring. This is a very complicated point to get across but I will try. Obviously, you still should care enough not to get in trouble in public or put yourself in dangerous positions. But it really is just an attitude thing. You have to have the attitude that you are not going t o allow anything in society to get in the way of you expressing your confident self to the world. Nothing. Not fear. Not that the girl is surrounded by 10 other hit girls, Not that she has a guy with her. Not that her parents are with her. Not that you had a bad day at work and you just aren't feeling it today. Etc, etc. The list of excuses that we make for ourselves can go on for a lifetime and the difference between you just going over and finding out in real life what will happen if you tackle these obstacles head on and you not tackling is will power. and warm-up and practice of course. But along with that comes that you shouldn't put yourself in dangerous situations and your first instinct when encountering hostility is to back off. I mean that if you are in physical danger, don't fight someone to prove your confidence. That is a lose lose battle all the way. So in the end, courage and not caring are highly discretionary. But truly not caring will get you through to the end. We will come back to this not caring principle. Step 2. Middle and Not Chasing This is something that I have come to realize very recently. There is no difference between you giving a girl your number and you getting hers. Her not texting you first is the same as her not texting you back. The only difference is that in the latter, you are stuck staring or cursing at your phone for hours wondering what you did wrong in the interaction and question every letter of the text. The trick is really to let go. If the real reason a girl doesn't want to go on a date with you is because you typed 'Hey!!"" in stead of ""Hey :)"" or ""What's up"" then she is worthless and not the assertive principled type of girl that you are looking for in the first place. Or your initial interaction didn't go as well as you thought. In any case, there is nothing you can do about that when sending the first message so just 'let go, let god' as my mother would say. I am of the opinion that for the first few months and in specific circumstances you should take the girls number. It can be a very assertive thing and provide you with the confidence you need to continue this journey. But remember never use getting numbers as a goal. The next part of this step is not chasing women. This was one of the the easiest and hardest steps to incorporate into my game. It doesn't mean stop approaching girls because in most universes that means that you won''t get any girls at all. It is mostly an attitude change. Imagine being a girl for a second and thinking that this guy that you talked to last night was cool so you hope they text you the next day. If not, sucks, maybe the next guy will be more assertive. We can coop and use that same entitled attitude ourselves. I am an awesome guy and if a girl wants to be in contact with me, this is a 2-way street. She can contact me or she can text back or she can show up to this even that I invited her to. If not, then she is not the assertive self-respecting principled girl that I really want in my sexual or romantic life. This is where the not caring attitude really changed things for me. I will now send a text to a girl and forget about it. If she responds, awesome, If not, I have no worries. I will just move on to the next girl or to my next homework or my next friendship. I give girls the same amount of chances that I give my male friends. If a guy doesn't text me back, he clearly doesn't want a relationship with me so I will just leave it at that. If I see that female again in the future, I just treat her as an acquaintance. Most of the time they start sputtering excuses about why they weren't able to text back. You see the light turn on in some of their heads when they see that you truly could not care less for their bullshit.That's when some of them will actually start pursuing you to the same fervor that you used to chase these girls with. It's a beautiful thing. It feels really good. You start to realize that you are someone worth pursuing too. You are an awesome person with perks and flaws that deserves a genuine person just like these women. When you reach this stage of self realization, that is when you really start seeing results. But be careful. 1st - it took me almost 4 years to get to where I am now. 2nd - don't let it go to your head. This can lead you to become one of those douche bags that you used to hate when you used to not be able to even talk to girls this hot. Above all, try to maintain some integrity and values through this process. What I mean by this is, always be honest. Lying your way into some pussy is just as a girl tricking you with Hollywood style makeup. Quality over quantity. but I will admit, I've made sacrifices on the way. I don't know. Just trust the process, At the end, if you do end up doing something you regret, don't forget to apologize and move on and don't repeat your mistakes. Step 3: Have fun The number one rule of going to a club or bar or anywhere is that you have to bring the fun and enjoyment with you. If you just try to jump into a random group acting gloomy, you will essentially be acting as a joy leech. Don't expect others to raise your mood. Many times when I have gone out when I was feeling bad, I've had to do a 'fake it till you make it' kinda thing. This is something that you might even have to adopt on the way to the ultimate confidence that I was talking about earlier. Imagine yourself as a happy person. Imagine yourself on the greatest day/night/moment of your life. Now go talk to people with that attitude. Don't stop approaching and having fake fun until it turns into real fun. Every time I've gone out and tried this (I mean really went and tried. Like talked to every human I saw. Giving random people high fives is super therapeutic and helps a lot with fostering this attitude) I haven't had a bad night. This is what some people call 'getting into state' or 'warming up to God mode'. When you truly reach that state of fun and not caring, it is euphoric and you are really unstoppable. You'll know when you reach it. No negative reaction can ruin your mood. Nothing can bring you down. This is probably the number one feeling that I have ever felt and I strive for it every time I go out (most times). I must admit even I have those nights when it is hard to even get a high five out. But this is when you really have to dig down and trust the process and fake it as hard as you can. Oscar award winning faking until you make it to the motherfucking top. When you leave your house, don't have expectations for the night. Don't set quotas for numbers, or kissing, or blowjobs or getting laid. Got out and have fun and those things are bound to happen. and if they don't, at least you had fun. This is the difference between being a pick up artist and a normal cool guy. No expectations. Extras. not every girl will like you. also, not every version of yourself can go out to the club. The 'best moment of my life' version of yourself is the one that will succeed in the club. the 'confident and I know things and I'm going to class' version is the one that will succeed in the day. The 'study' version will work best for classes ant tests (in actual college courses) (I mean like actual studying for biology or engineering). Be that you that would kill at what every you are trying to kill at. Last step: closing how to close, I struggled with this one the most in my journey. It seemed like I was getting all the way and just not having the ability to finish. The sticking point I had was literally that I just had to actually start going for it. I found that often I wasn't even asking these girls to come home with me. If you combined the going for it with confidence and not caring what she says, you have the best chance of success. On the way back to my place, I always just bullshitted and made dumb conversation and ignored any shit test or bullshit comment that the girl threw at me to throw me off of sex. Shit test - qualification test from the girl to see if you really are the confident boss man that she met in the club. If you behave or answer correctly, she will sleep with your ( or do whatever you are going for). if you answer incorrectly, you will get nothing. examples - I'm tired, you're a hoe, you probably sleep with a lot of girls, you're a player, you're smart, I'm not that kind of girl, I've only slept with (#) of guys, I'm on my period (sometimes they are but you can still get a blowjob or something else if you want), We're not having sex tonight (said with a smile on her face and with few clothes on, you often can get her to reconsider with more kissing and vagina touching. also let her touch your hard dick), etc one of the most helpful ways of dealing with shit tests comes in the form of the phrase ""when in doubt, whip it out"". This means that if you are sure that the girl probably wants to have sex with you at some point but is playing games in the moment, just pull out your dick and put it in her hand. It is a great move for rookies and professionals alike. It works or it doesn't work but the point is to foster that confidence in yourself to not care her reaction. Use that as a template for skipping shit tests and last minute resistances. Also, cuddling can suck. If you are like me and don't like cuddling, be honest with the girl and let her know that you would like her to leave and pay for a cab or Uber or that you don't cuddle and you would like her to stick to her side of the bed (in a maybe or maybe not less blunt way. personal preference and up to you. ) Random and I'm not sure where this fits but sexy is a personality trait. A girl that is sexy has some experience with men and you can judge from there. This can be a positive thing or a negative thing. It will be fleshed out separately in a different post. This is a fun distinction that I came up with with my friends and as such doesn't hold as much water as the rest of the post. Mostly interesting as a thought experiment. final thoughts. Once you have all of these things down, being yourself is important. Don't compromise your standards or values for people for a fun night. You most likely will regret it in the morning. A good exercise is to write down 2-5 qualities that you will not sacrifice on for any romantic partner. I recommend at lease one trait based on looks and one based on personality. If a girl is being a dick and not responding and you find yourself caring, stop that. Give a girl 1-3 chances to accept your invitation to go out on a date. After that the onus will be on her to initiate a romantic adventure. You shall only worry about getting that pussy after that. There are exceptions for genuinely busy people, but three cancellations means that clearly she isn't serious about this. So neither should you. Now for getting into a relationship, I'm admittedly at a loss. I've never been in one. But I imagine that they work the best when you are truly friends with the girl. Like you would text her the same things that you would text your guy friends. Your treat her the same as you would treat a best man friend. Except you have sex. Also, these 'techniques' should work on any woman. They are not manipulative or evil or sexist or bad. If you choose to remain on the side of the light and remain honest in all of your experiences, you won't be compromising yourself for the short-term girls vs the long-term girls. Also, if a girl ditches you for someone else, her romantic chances are done. You may go back and sleep with her as a revenge kind of thing but I highly recommend having some 'drop immediately' standards (where you completely and unequivocally shun a girl). Some that I have is if I get dropped for someone ' better' and she comes back; If she cheats; if she is a feminist (refer to previous posts, might be specifically fleshed out in later posts too); and if she exhibits the qualities of a crazy person. Also, talk with your friends about situations that are if your girl or their girls ever approach you or them for sexual shit. Make sure you don't have conflicting values and that some stupid girl can't split your close bonds. My personal situation is I really don't care. If she does, then she gets dropped and I can move on. And I gained a new Eskimo bro haha.-------But for real here... If the guy is your friend he should probably shun that bitch straight off and let you know."
My dad used to beat my mother,2017-04-05 01:39:00,"I have a negative emotion associated with this memory. I still get teared up whenever I think about it and according to Jordan Peterson, if you think of a memory and a negative emotion is produced, you haven't fully articulated and understood the memory. So here I am. I want to run through a list of some of this shit that I have been holding onto. Even the deepest darkest secret that I hold over my death. I'd literally rather not live in a world where the reality of my actions as a teen and child were realised by society. I remember we used to be sleeping at night or during the day and be woken up by yelling. My brother and I would look at each other and wonder what this fresh hell was all about. Had my mother donated too much money to Benny Hinn or TBN? Had there been a car that was unrecognised in the parking lot? Had some man made eye contact with my mom at some point during the day? It was random and at that young age, I really couldn't make anything of it. The strongest memory of that time at 228 Glen Abbey Lane was when the worst of it happened. It was a beating but it sounded worse than the others. Doors sounded like they had been broken downstairs. We would hear my father yell out a question to which he would receive the same answer... then sounds. Horrifying sounds. I never actually saw any of the violence. But damn sure I could hear all of it. Sounds of things breaking, things hitting other things, and then the sound of my mother crying or groaning in pain. That one night it was too much. I don't remember if it was me or my brother that typed 911 into the phone but it got typed. I do know that it was my brother who had the phone in his hand when my dad came up the stairs. To this day, I don't know why this was the night we decided to take action. But here we were. We both ran to our rooms. My dad busted in. I think he asked my where my brother was and I pointed up to the top bunk. My dad started yelling and yelling and then climbed partway up and started lunging at my brother, trying to get at him. He screamed and screamed, ""Help, help, mommy, mommy"" or something along those lines. My mom took that opportunity to run down to the gas station which was probably a half mile from the house to call the police from there. 4 cop cars showed up that day and took my dad out. We had peace that night. In the months and years that went by, a cycle appeared. There was never any physical violence but always yelling, yelling, threats of violence, and verbal aggression. We would always afraid that things would precipitate again back to the way they were that night. My brother and I became bolder and bolder but it was only when we were in high school when we started to actually fight back. My brother, my dad and I lived in the basement of the house that my parents still live into this day. Everyone else stayed upstairs. My parents never slept in the same bed. I was of the opinion that they should divorce. And finally, it happened. Official separation. I don't remember what it was that caused that but here we were. My dad lived in another place. We would visit sometimes. This is the only time I really remember liking my dad. He became somewhat cool. He would buy us things. He actually spent the money on cable so we got to watch channels that we had never seen before. My personal favourite was BET because they always did a top ten rap videos segment and I would get to see music and artists that I otherwise wouldn't be exposed to. My mom tried to make me go to therapy but I refused. I was closed up and shut in. Rebellious little kid. I don't know why I refused. I think to some extent it was in the preservation of the short tenuous decent I finally had with my dad and I wanted him to think more of me since I resisted. I don't remember if he had said anything that would make me think that he would approve of this. Maybe he asked about it and I had the intuition that it would make him happy if I didn't go. Then they got back together. I don't know why my mom is so weak. She used some bullshit scripture and the bible and church to justify her decision but it was bullshit. Fuck her for that. That threw the whole family back into flux and hell until I finally got to leave. Here I will just outline the awful memories that I have along with my darkest secret. In fact, let me just get that out of the way. I have no clue how this happened. I really don't. As kids, my two sisters and I would play and a few times they were naked. I didn't do anything and I wasn't literate or understanding enough to know anything sexual, which was a good thing. Anyway, there was one memory when I was at Glen Abbey Lane when I wanted them to sit on my back and pee... That is all I remember. The older sister was able to but only a very small bit. The younger one was not and she ran to my mom to complain about it. I ran after her, knowing on some level that what I and they were doing was wrong. Nothing came of that. Many years later, in the house my parents live in now, my sisters wanted to play a game. They called it the baby game. They would run and hide (not very well) with their butts in the air and I would find them and spank them when they were found. We played this a few times. My dad figured something out and one day burst through the door to the upstairs accusing me and my brother of sexual malfeasance. I denied like this was going to be my last day on earth, knowing that admitting guilt might make this my last day on earth. A whole stink was made. What I am most ashamed of was looking at my youngest sister's vagina. I would pull down her pants and spread it and look at it and sniff her butt. Why? I don't know. She told my mom one time but it was chalked up to ""kid's say the darndest things"". I obviously denied that till the ducks came home. I know now it was wrong. I acknowledge my actions here, to myself, and I repent to myself since I am my own god and I forgive myself for that same reason. Another time, this time after my parents had gotten back together, I was accused of watching porn on my dad's computer. I did not. I would never. I had an iPod touch at the time, with access to wifi, so the idea that I would risk some shit to do it on a computer is retarded. That turned into a big event because I maintained my innocence and my parents maintained my guilt because my dad maintained that he had evidence against me. Yelling ensued, I tried to call the police, he scratched my neck, and I ran down the street to where there was a police car parked outside of a person's house. I always saw that cop car there so I assumed a policeman lived there. I knocked on the door, crying my eyes out and explained part of the situation. The man called his fellow guys. They took pictures of my neck and took my dad away for the second time in my life. I was happy to see him go. I was ecstatic about the possibility of going to court to testify against him. I wanted him to go to jail. Guess what bullshit happened then. We arrived at the courthouse. I don't remember if it was my mom or dad but they did some shit to where the charge was dropped. I was livid. There was a time when I was a kid and I got into an argument with another kid at school. It got to a point where I was sitting down outside at recess and he was hovering over me. Imagine a kid sitting down at a picnic table, with his back to the table, with another kid standing in front, facing kid 1 with hands on either side of the kid 1 on the table. I was scared so I bit Zachary Spadafore's left arm. I got put on the wall at recess (where you have to stand against a brick wall for all of the recess instead of playing) and I got sent home with a note that said things. I showed it to my mom and she said that she would have to show it to my dad when he got home from work. I have never been so scared in my life. I sat in my room for hours waiting, waiting, waiting. ""Chibuzor!"" That call came from downstairs. You always came immediately because if he had to call a second time, your beating would be worse. When I came downstairs, things happened. Most of the memory is gone now for whatever reason (probably because it was so traumatic). I do remember a few things, though. The first was that my dad kept asking the same questions over and over again. He would ask, ""Why did you bite him?"" and I would answer, ""Because he was hovering over me."" And then I would be hit. And he would ask the question again. I would answer and then be hit. No reason, logic, or explanation ever stopped this wrath. It just kept on until it stopped. The last thing I care to go over in my past that I think about was the last time I was full on triggered. There are very very few times in my life that I have been so angry that my face and body vibrated. I'd say most of them came from interactions with my dad. In this last episode, he was saying some wild shit about kicking one of my sisters out of the house for some reason or other. He was saying wild things that were causing them to cry and be as angry as I was. As per the usual, my brother and I would sit at the bottom the basement stairwell and listen with plans of intervening if things got bad enough. I'll skip to the part about me. If I remember correctly, my mother and sisters had left the premises because of all the nonsense. I was cool headed trying to reason with my dad and I think my brother was too. I was trying to make him understand something (I don't remember what) and I said something about how we would be better off if they had been divorced. My brother and dad both vehemently disagreed and that was one of the moments where I lost it. Everything that had ben brewing inside that I never ever got to say came out. I told him I hated him. I told him to go fuck himself. I told him that he was a bad person and a bad father. And more. I said a lot more. And he yelled back of course, but you know damn well he didn't threaten me. I was in the tail end of high school then, he wouldn't dare. I lifted then. I said all the things and called my mom crying and telling her that this was the final straw. She had to leave him. I rationally outlined the reasons why with the biggest one being that she had a responsibility to keep the children safe. I knew that I would be gone and leaving soon but everyone else would still have to stay and deal with this monster of a human being. She started crying too. and then my dad came downstairs and told me to leave. Which I did. I called one of my best friends out of the blue, Evan Stalnaker, and asked him to come pick me up. He said yes, no questions asked. He arrived and even with me yelling curse words out the window and as I was getting into the car, no questions asked. I love him for that. I will always love him for that. I will never love my dad. If the love I have for people in this life is to mean anything, I can't let him be a part of that. I didn't talk to my dad for a whole year from that date. When my Nigerian uncle came to visit, he more or less forced my to go upstairs for the first time in a year and say something to him. It was weird. I would have probably been finer with never resuming the relationship but things are how they are. We now have some superficial ""hey, what's up, nothing, what's up with you, nothing, you've been good, yes what about you, yeah I'm doing good"" kind of relationship. And I am fine with that. If anything, he taught me that people don't change. It's possible but a genuine change in a person is hard and required significant effort over years. For other humans, if a significant toxic flaw that big is identified, it is best to get the fuck out and never return. In some years, people may be different but it is best to dissociate from toxicity in case you, yourself get infected. It has taken me a long time to figure out what love means to me. It's not this bullshit ""love everyone"". And it's certainly not 'love' because you're supposed to because of family. For me now, love is a two way street of a relationship where I care about a person and a person cares about me in return. Care is proven or validated through mutual voluntary contact and valuable quality time spent together. Love is admitting fault when a mistake is made or hurtful words are said. My mother has apologised. It was I awhile ago but I remember it happening. My father hasn't said jack shit. He doesn't call me and he doesn't talk to me voluntarily. He doesn't actually like me and I don't actually like him. And that's fine. People I genuinely love: my mother (not a tonne but it is there), my brothers, and sisters, Kwaku, Seth, Evan, Nima, Koby, Mike, Eyill, Adam from Cinci, Dustin. These are all people who I know for a fact would come to my aid if I was ever in trouble, and I would do the same for them. That's all. I feel a bit bit better. This was good. Okay. bye."
hurts to hear her moving on,2021-03-11 16:25:00,"she's going on dates, she's planning trips, she's making moneyMary's life is going well. and all in all mine is too. I think I can get back into the girl thing at any time, I have money (almost), health insurance, hobbies, and opportunities for the future. Still though, someone else is going to fuck her. maybe not today or tomorrow but sometime. She's not mine anymore. I can't force her to only be with me while I do anything that I want. So I just have to watch slowly while she drifts away into the world of the world. And I'm okay with all of this happening - but it still hurts. I know why I'm doing all this. Give an opportunity to an amazing friend and also have the opportunity to have a place to stay in Moscow while I stay there. But fuck. and she's even cool with me banging chicks at her place while she's on vacation. but damn if I have to think about her with some dude, holding hands, kissing, and even banging. wow. thats a bad feeling.I remember back when I saw that shit first hand. I went through such a whirlwind of emotions. Most of them were directly blocked but they came out in wierd ways. my filming and making a lot of snapchat stories, having to record my feelings in the moment and attempt to understand and explain the complexities of an open relaitonshp and get to the other side of that. I literally climbed the side of a 5 story building with no ladder guard and walked around on the roof. I just became woefully and wildly reckless and dangerous. I wasn't suicidal but I didn't care about my life as much. I feel the same when I am in the room with a new girl and the idea or convo about condoms comes up. I fundamentally don't care about life and I've completely rationalized that STDs aren't dangerous and even if I get HIV I can take a pill forever and not have it affect anything I do. I even have negative tests that go back years so if I need a visa or passport to another country, I can just use that shit.but the recklessness with which I acted that night scares me. I could have died that night. and for what. the opportunity to fuck a new girl and watch my girlfriend makeout with and almost bang and sleep with a guy in my bed? nah.but here we aren't together anymore. I will not see them do shit and by the time any relationship would develop, I will have moved on to other things. but it hurts in the moment. just like lifting. just like dancing. just like studying. just like cold approaching. just like anything worth having."
I don't want it,2017-04-23 05:40:00,The same post 4-5 times in a row . This time I'm a actually in field. I don't want to talk to any girls. I only want to talk to my friends. I want my safe space. I look good as fuck but I'm not out here. Not sure what to think of myself. I would be disappointed in someone else if they conked out on me like this.
My Last weekend in Boston,2017-08-14 18:56:00,"I went to see Mike and Dustin in Boston this weekend. I didn't get to hang out with Dustin as often as I would have liked as a symptom of him hanging with a lot of chill guys and me hanging out with a more lit Mike. I did some cold-approach street action for the first time in a very very long time. I didn't get any hard rejection from the street interactions. The best of the street interactions occurred on Saturday. We met two girls on the site of the Boston Massacre, which ended up being Mike's opener. We talked for 10-15 minutes. The conversation was mainly my jokes and guesses at each of their occupations and then the group's riffs on how wrong I was. The one girl was an actual doctor and the other was a wine saleswoman. She recommended that I try Brunello Di Montalcino and she described the taste with such enthusiasm and colorful imagery, explaining where the term 'oaky' when describing the taste of a wine comes from and why this wine was not oaky because to was brewed in a different type of barrel than that which we produce wine there-in in the US. Knowledgeable and pretty. She had great posture and was slightly muscular with a pleasant slimness that indicated an attention to her physical look that escapes the common woman. A brunette girl who remained unafraid to hold eye contact and even more unafraid to assert her beliefs, thoughts, and opinions into the world. I threw in some wing-manning since I did not live there and tried to get Mike the number. She confidently refused with the word 'no' perfectly perched on her smiling but firm lips. This was an interesting departure from the common insecurity plaguing most women where they feel the need to beat you over the head with the amount and important-ness of each new excuse. This girl was confident and strident in her simple refusal. She softened the blow by saying that she genuinely enjoyed the interaction and thought we are cool guys. We left there to dance in this club named Royale that had a $25 cover. I did decent inside. I got more rejections than acceptances. I those venues I rely solely on my looks to procure the women's affection. This does not work for me especially in a place like that that did not have room for my swing dancing and only had room for grinding or conversation in ears. I would go back to a drawing board to revise the game here and get back to my optimal state, but I think I will not. I like dancing and this current state is more a reflection of Chi. Better game is better game though so I will not stop my body from naturally correcting for the mistakes that it finds during future trips. We ended up meeting two girls at or after getting pizza and danced with them in a nearby park. I tried teaching them my swing dance moves which were extremely fun. They were not good at dancing at all and I have not been able to effectively lead the movement that is my favorite. This lead to my wrist taking all of the weight of the one girl to prevent her from hitting the ground. This was immensely fun for the girls and, unfortunately, I woke up the next day with a biting pain in my wrist. They ended up on the phone with some guy who was asking them if they wanted to hang out with Drake. They did and they got into a car and left. Conclusions from the weekend: 1) Don't espouse opinions that you aren't ready and willing to defend 2) Conspiracy theories don't matter and talking them only leads to getting in the weeds with people who have not done nor care to do the necessary research to confirm or deny your claim. 3) I am beautiful to some people and ugly to others 4) Snapchat has a feature that lets you know the location of every person that you are friends with. Wild. This will change my life. Pseudo-serendipity will occur more often and might become an integral part of the game. The impact of this revelation means that I can get a number and avoid texting a girl altogether in lieu of a serendipitous in-person meeting. More instant dates, more coordination of dates that don't have to pass through the filter of the games that are played by all humans when they communicate through text, and more sex because of those two. I'm about to go full hoe in a way that has previously eluded me. I'm frightened and excited by the prospect. Bye p.s. I got in a small debate argument about 9/11 and moon landing conspiracies and was unable to defend against the counter-evidential claims that were made against me. This made me seem ignorant and dumb for espousing any claims to those events. It hurt not being able to refute the evidence and explanations that were thrown back at me. I had that feeling and the judgment of wrongdoing that came as a result of being unable to defend that which I believed. For all other shit that I give Gabby and everyone else that believes she without thought or contemplation, here I am seemingly doing the same thing. I still hold the same opinion after reviewing the sources that convinced me in the first place and reviewing their debunking of the official NIST report and of the claims that I was hearing from Mike. If you want to debate shit, know your position and defend it with vehemence."
Am I still a bully?,2017-02-27 21:17:00,"Couple examples of bullying from various stages of my life Early Childhood - No reasons I use that word still because I haven't self-reflected on my growth in this area since I thought about the events of my childhood. I bullied kids all the time. I punched, kicked, tripped, and bit my way through elementary school and middle school. I remember a time when I saw a kid running past me and I deliberately stuck my foot out so that he would fall, which he did, There was no reason. Another time I remember kicking or somehow hurting some boy when I was in 3rd or 4th grade. I think that I was kicking him in the balls. I don't remember the sequence of events but all I do know is that he was crying. No reason that I now remember. Middle Childhood - Reasons but were they justified? 6th grade while we were dissecting owl pellets, I told some girl in my group that if she kept digging around, she would find her parents in there (the owl pellet). I got sent to the principal's office. To me, it was just a joke and I couldn't imagine why I was getting in trouble for it. 9th grade I kept calling this fat kid a faggot and laughed as he chased me around the gym. He caught up to me after class and tried to fight me in front of all of the upperclassmen. I ran and ended up in the principal's office. I was the one in trouble. It was funny to me. Junior year of college, I made a girl cry because she didn't live up to the standard I set for her (see blog post on Hayley). My reason here was that I wanted to see her improve. Junior year, I made multiple girls cry because they disagreed with my polarized politics. My reason was that I thought I was right and that the whole world needed to know. Current life Am I still a bully, though? In 2017? This is the question on my mind right now and I really want to be thorough here. This came up after I expressed that I really like small girls and I didn't know why. One of my friends took the moment to tell me it is because I am a bully. This didn't register immediately but after some thought and some examples of my 'bullying', I decided that the claim might hold some water. I don't know about how liking small girls (and when I say small girls I mean physically small, not young) Let's look back through my experience. We are going to go through at the end and decide whether each is actual bullying and which are maybe not. Everytime someone tells me that they have a major outside of STEM, I usually make fun of them or poked fun at them for that decision. I have been doing that less lately but it still triggers a response in my mind that manifests in action depending on the situation. I often poke fun at or make fun of people that I am friends with who are overweight in any capacity. I'll grab their fat, question their progress, and make insensitive jokes that I think are funny. I could be seen as bullying with my informed opinion. If someone thinks differently than me, I will sometimes try to correct their thinking with my evidence. Last would be that I make fun of guys who don't approach girls. If guys rely on online dating and are too scared to get up and talk to a real life human female, I usually ridicule. My friend Nate said that I like small girls because I like to dominate people and small girls offer little resistance to my massive presence. These are expounded examples of what he gave as the evidence that I am still a bully who likes to crush weaker people that present themselves before me. I do want to be clear that this definitely isn't something that defines me. It is a big part and I do see where insulting others in the form of insensitive jokes and having fun at others expense occurs on a semi-regular basis in my life. I'm trying to make this distinction because I do see myself as sharing at times and working with others at times toward my goals. It could be completely true, though. For example, once I fuck a girl, there is no more respect for her from me, Through this lens, it was because she failed my ultimate test of not succumbing to the degradation of being my masturbatory device of the next few minutes. It could make sense because it is said that the bully degrades others in an effort to bolster himself in areas that he feels inadequate. When I am at school, I lack in everything. Social acuity, body strength, smarts, and entertainment are all competing for my time and I am the one that is losing. This could explain the lashing out against everyone that my friend noticed. Respect goes to people who I see as impervious to being pushed over. Impervious to casual remarks. They survive in spite of people fucking with them on a regular basis. They are the Osho's proverbial empty boat with dreams and goals. They are offering the other humans they come across nothing to latch onto, nothing to destroy them with. Their ego has direction and their identity is attached to their own being rather than the validation or non-validation of those around. If I become like the people that I respect, I will not be bullying people for self-validation. This is something that is preached by everyone that I follow in the PUA community. Tread the paradoxical line of being free of outcome and having the determination to still try to accomplish said outcome be perfecting intent. When I was working all of the last year, I felt better in all of those areas and I don't think that I lashed out at those around me at all. Maybe against some women sometimes but I think that I survived without that shit for the most part. The way to fix this is to stop letting one thing (entertainment) dominate your life and make time for all of the other things so that you don't feel the need to act like your dad. Yep. The big giant dick of the elephant in the room. It's hard to escape that cycle. My dad was a bully who beat my mom and now I am a bully when I feel inadequate. At least I know how to fix my shit. This might be a big caveat. I fight against the feminist worldview on a regular basis but they do have a few real points. Roosh V brought this up in his most recent video. The women of today treat themselves like slabs of meat and encourage their own objectification. Sex is no longer sacred. The day that contraception was created and the day that the birth control pill was released on the market, romantic shit was done. I do wish I could have experienced how the society was before. Sure, I probably wouldn't be getting a new pussy every month but it looks like it may have been more fulfilling than this. I need to find a new way to generate initial respect in this female homo sapiens. I can rev my game engine and let it run only for a few hours a week before there is nothing left for me to feel towards females other than dislike. According to the people that I follow, If you are getting that burnt out hatred feeling it is because you are being inauthentic."
closed loop - I am a false alarm,2016-11-30 23:56:00,"Do I really think it's okay to not do something that will be good for me because I don't want to? Hmm. I should cold approach girls and guys on a regular basis. I should introduce myself to the new personnel that work in my office. I should lift. I should go to dance class. But I don't want to. Questions is will I enjoy it if I do so? After and during all of those things I will feel good. In fact, doing those things is the only thing that will keep me sane by the time I end up in bed. So what is that balance? When do I do things that I don't want to? That seems like a pretty easy question to answer: whenever you know that it will make you a better person and when your mental health is contingent on completing the aforementioned actions (albeit not literally. Nigga when the fuck has, ""I don't want to"" been an acceptable answer? Would you accept it from anyone else? No. Be better. We definitely needed to have this conversation because frankly, it's ridiculous that you at any point though this was okay after all of the experience you have in the game. Now New York. I got hurt a couple approaches upfront but for the most part I refused to play the game. That was me being a pussy. A girl at one point came alone to stand 5 inches in front of me and dance. I don't think I have had any more clear invitation from a girl other than direct contact initiation from the girl. But I didn't want to. I actually walked away and thought I might come back and dance with her but even then I didn't act. The cycle of in action. I love the show westworld because it is teaching me so much about humans. We really are all stuck in our closed loops. We have this ego about our existence but when you really look at your life your can notice several loops of action, conversation, and state. I am going to break that shit. Or at least change my loop into something I respect, something that will make me great, something that will make me enjoy life more. I could easily have run Marquee. I could have taken all those girls and danced the night away. I could have been up till 6 am actually doing shit with people that I liked. Or I could have been going home all the same knowing that I at least tried. The bars that I need to redeem myself include the standard highline hotel, the avenue, and marquee. Also, the general streets of New York need my love. I need to go through the failure challenges. Do things knowing that you will be rejected. On purpose my nigga. 100 days of failure. That shit is daunting. All self help programs are a set of days where you are supposed to break yourself out of your comfort loop and take action. I'm going to need to write myself something of the sort so that I can really be ready for this trip to Europe. The girls are going to be just as attractive. The girls are going to be in the same large groups. It will still be up to you to make things happen. Your goal is to go to each city and country and talk to enough girls to ostensible have formed an opinion about the people that live in that country. It will obviously not be representative This is your goal though. We know that you like to speak in blankets, lol you don't need to add that caveat here. Anyway. Also I need to stop creating that dichotomy of type one and type two girls. That is some fuckboy shit and it won't work on real girls. Too easily you can get sucked into the trap of 'do you still fuck all of these type one girls' or 'which one am I' and then if you say that the girl is a type two girl, she will feel the obligation not to fuck you because she now has to live up to that good girl bar you threw her up to. Which is bullshit because that is not why we're here. LETS GET FUCKING REAL. I am here to fuck girls. That is it. I am done playing this game like I am going to find a wife out here. I am a hoe. I am a fuckboy. I will fuck you and then leave. If I like you I will fuck you twice. Then forreal I am gone. I am what The Weeknd would call a false alarm. I've got a good time wrapped in gold for you. I love everybody, can't you tell... I've kept this good boy thing going for some time but I'm done. It isn't real. I'm a coldly logical lad who uses rhetoric an emotion to manipulate who I can. I read body language and recognize microexpressions with the least of them. Really I'm just developing this set of skills and understanding of human nature to fuck every girl I know. Hos long can I stand it? haha. Maybe I'll become a person one day. That day is not today."
by by acquaintences and kinda friends and Nate (my old best bud),2017-11-30 00:51:00,"I've grown tired over the past few years from people that talk out of their ass about things that they don't understand. Subjects that these individuals haven't researched or read a single book on. They just think because they go into a room for 2 hours a day for 5 months and cheat on a few tests, they can come out the mouth with opinions on some shit. Well, no. Actually, you can't. Not while I'm in the same room or the same group chat. I've never really been too fond of Kwaku's new friends. They have always been his friends, not mine. They have always represented the wrong side of the fence. Liberalism, normi-ism, pussy-ism (not talking to girls you like), violence in response to non-violence, and more. I have objected most every time I've seen one of these transgressions and today that shit has come to a head. Actually, over two days, the shit has come to a head. Yesterday, we were talking about some shit and Nate exclaimed that he would wear women's clothes if his future daughter wanted him to. It sounded nice and virtuous on its head but really made no sense upon investigation. Why would you cross-dress for your child? Couldn't this confuse the ideas of sexuality and gender in the child's mind? Couldn't it be harmful to this end? What context would this even occur under where this is the decision that must be made? So many questions and only deflections for answers. Instead of answering, Nate decided he didn't owe anyone answers. It was his unjustified, un-examined thought and he was allowed to have it. And he is right. What he was incorrect about was that I would just sit down and allow nonsensical virtuous shit to be sprouted out around me with out examination. Part 2. He complained about his grade on some industrial engineering test. Now, industrial engineering is the easiest of all of the engineering. My mans is coming from chemical which holds the cake as the hardest of all of the engineering. How you struggling bruv? Allegedly my nigga has been studying nonstop and not going out but here we are. Part 3. As if to confirm my suspicions, the man texts the group chat asking everyone to come out to happy hour. Da fuck. Moments after you complaining about your grades. So, as the cunt that I am, I texted that anyone looking for a valid excuse could find at least a few located on the finals schedule. Part 4. The straw that broke the fragile man's back. Nicky texted the group that Bitcoin was falling. He laughed and said that it was a bad investment and was an illegitimate currency. I saw blood and jumped in. I quickly found out that I was debating people that didn't have a basic grasp of economics or how currencies worked. They didn't even actually know what bitcoin was. Then, Nate decided to jump in and ask me what bitcoins are. I tell him to google the shit just like I did. He mentioned that I should know if I am challenging a business major on the subject. That pissed me off (in that context but in reality this means that I typed harder for 2 minutes then went back to my life). This was an appeal to authority fallacy but not only that, it was an appeal to authority of a credential that the man doesn't even have! He is pursuing a degree and thus has taken the same or less of that class material as me! And also who gives a fuck about your education. Since when did an education trump a good argument? Fuck outta here. Any way I showed them why they were wrong, Nicky got offended and kicked me from the chat. This is good. I, in general, did not want to be a part of that chat to begin with. GroupMe is fine but having a group chat coming through on my iMessage is aggravating because if keeps a notification flag on my iMessage app icon. In conclusion, this is what is wrong with the culture in 2017. In the past, you would have arguments in person and then, most of the time, agree to disagree and move on with your lives. A couple time s in my life, those conversations have come to a head and ended with a radio silence in the relationship that ranged from 1 week to 1 month. But since what we argue about usually doesn't matter, you make up and move on. In recent years, all of this discourse happens online. And the equivalent to radio silence online is blocking or removing the other person. The difference is that there is now no opportunity for conversation to continue. No talks can be had. Ever again. It is the death of the relationship. The fragility of your emotions led you to do the thinkable and block. Instead of saying, I'm done with this conversation, let's resume this later or talk about something else, you removed or blocked. Ite. good. I don't need fragile people in my life. #NoNewSnowflakes"
control,2021-03-11 16:13:00,"I learned something today - or figured out somethingA reaction that I have in many situations - and that is when I lose control of a situation I can get very disagreeable, frustrated and/or anxious.This has manifested in my social/dance 'teachings' with Jack where if I get pushback in that he won't do an action that I tell him, I double down on trying to convince him or I shut down and that experience ends. With my dealings with Mary, I think we've been together for so long because I've been able to convince her of all or most of my thoughts and opinions. In this situation, there isn't a natural end to the relationship because every time, I get bring it back to where it started or where I want it to be in that very moment. With my mother and father, I get very angry when they decide that my plan is inferior and they want to do things their way which is usually cheaper but more inconvenient and time intensiveWith Lisa, when I met her at the train station and she didn't reciprocate my feelings and actions of the love and feeling that I felt in the moment, I immediately shut down and became disagreeable and only opened up to the extent that I understood would lead me to have sex with her. I took a mechanical route to stay alive in the moment and eventually ended up getting my bodily wants while sacrificing my mind.What frustrates me about a lot of situations in life is that I can't engineer them the same way I can engineer my relationships with females. Life is so much more complicated and the reward to it isn't so clear and direct. It took my all of 8 years of Game and 6 years of University to get where I am now and I shudder to imagine the grind that I have to go on again to become a professional dancer or singer or instagram person or man of clout. I know that it's possible but the steps and things to do hurt my head.I feel like I do a lot of things out of spite to my past self and my current self. My past self because I hate, dislike and disrespect that pussy of a guy and my current self because not so deep down I don't get the purpose of living but this pleasurable activity is one irresponsible dirty stupid thing that I can still do. Sometimes I see myself as someone dragging people to that dark side. I bring people to my level through my actions and I try to find as many new victims as possible. I love meeting people who are already defiled and moral-less. I look at them with wonder, love, and disgust. Mary told me today that she was going to go on a trip with her 'gay' friend who she falls asleep and cuddles with. and I met the guy. he's definitely gay though I don't like the idea of him sleeping in a bed with my girl. AT THE SAME TIME, I have two new hoes without trying and I have it in my mind to continue fucking and doing shit when I land in Moscow. so it's a complete double standard. and in general i don't give a fuck about what random girls do. I just want my turn and then keep it moving but for some stupid reason, I give a fuck about what this girl does. Literally if i saw that the last 3 girls I banged were in relaitonships I wouldn't be bothered in the least. It reminds me of something. It's hard for me to quit somethings or to actively do many things consistently.Lifting, Playing guitar, dancing, business, and even work and I believe that I can add breaking up with a girl to that list. It's so hard to do that and it's easier in the meantime to maintain some kind of contact eternally. It's easier to lift 2-3 days a week and then take breaks on the way out. literally I can just not go.So in the end, my self diag is that I need ot chill, do things one at a time. pick activiites and actually do them one at a time until I get what I want.oh god. yeah that's the dangerous part. if I break down into being shut down or anxious and doing the next available action, often I end up in another situation that I don't want to be in. something where someone else or myself is hurt. either I waste someone's time, hurt their feelings, hurt my own feelings, or hinder my life progress. I don't want those mental/physical shutdowns because they lead to me defaulting to where I'm comfortable which is standard-lessly fucking girls, dancing, and sleeping."
I'm me. can i change at this point?,2017-04-14 08:34:00,"I have acted the exact same way every time I have liked a girl. Like a bitch. Like a pussy. I lose words and just say nonsense with a lot of pauses. I don't know how to be a person around women. That is why I hate them. I saw Olivia tonight. And she was single. And she liked me and she held my hand. And I ASKED HER TO KISS ME???? wtf. my nigga. c'mon. I haven't learned a goddamn thing. This is was turned her off in the first place. I always feel like I have to tread lightly, ever so lightly to preserve her affection and it always ends up in the dumps. There is no leading. There exists a negative, weird, anti-Chi energy every time there exists the opportunity for a longer term relationship ith a girl. I act differently. Just like I act different in Morgantown and I'm with my boys versus when I'm in a random city alone, I act different. I hate it. My face animates more. I start to fake try to teach others how to dance. This can work in my favour for some time but at the end, it always ends up weird. I can pull to the bar and motion f fuck this. Here I am with my head in my bands visualising all of the moments where a kiss was demanded by her face and body language. And I sat there and talked. I talked through every one of the moments. I talked through when she bought me a beer. I talked through when I motioned her over and we were alone. I literally reached around her to talk to a random guy named Adam when we were standing at the bar. Why? Because I'm a pussy ass bitch. I don't know why. I just am. I've tried to be better. I used to be better. THAT IS THE THING THAT IS MOST INFURIATING. I know that I would have been that nigga for her last year. I know that I would have closed last year. I know that I would have closed last month even. But for some goddamn reason here I am. Alone. I did awful. I did badly. I don't even know how to be better. The fact that I know how to be better at the moment and am not better at the moment is the tale told. I can't lead. I am relying on the gimmick of dancing to lead me to the promise land. Tonight, I needed alcohol to talk to the girls. This really is some fuck nigga shit. I really need to put poison into my body in ever increasing amounts in order to have a conversation with a member of the other sex. I need it. I actually feel like I need this substance. Otherwise, I would be paralysed in my inaction. Otherwise, I would be paralysed in my panic. Otherwise, I would be lost in my hatred and longing to be in a place of comfort. I need a safe space. I hate that. I don't want one. But after this week of rejection from interviewers, from school via tests, and from life via girls, I need a place where I can laugh and feel comfortable. I don't want to hurt anymore. I don't want to text Olivia next week. I really don't. I know the pain I will feel when we meet and she tells me that we should be friends again. I don't think I could handle that. I would break. Like the brittle little poptart bitch that I have become in Morgantown for whatever reason, I would break. I would crumble away like an ash statue in the wind. I know I will text her though. Why? Because of hope. Fuck hope. But I will text her because of hope. Hope that the world isn't the way it is. Hope that I am enough to satisfy her hoe mind and attention span. Hope that I will be able to break the cycle that has enslaved me my whole life and specifically the past few months. Hope that I will have a long term relationship with a girl I'm not related to. Yeah, yeah, brother I know it's futile and bullshit, but let me live. let. me. live. I'm hurting enough as it is. I need this to get through. I need hope. I need dreams. I need to dream. I need to dream of us and her responses to my words and our conversations and our arguments and our love and our kids and everything. I need to dream of our breakup and getting back together. I need to dream up the fights over nothing. I need to dream. I need to dream. Let me dream. Let me live."
unrealistic expectations,2023-05-17 10:55:00,"I am writing this journal to start to take into account my feelings and memories in the different moments in this life. I had a secret blog (still have) but I want to have a more consistent real journal on a platform. My entry for today is that I am treating video editing and sewing like picking up women or cheating in school. I'm looking for the quickest way to do things with isn't necessarily bad - the bad part comes in when I have unrealistic expectations for myself and others for how quickly I can get something done. I'm expecting to get a whole shirt or a whole Johnny Harris Level edit done in 2 hours and that just isn't realistic, especially at this point in my journey. I am kinda enjoying the process though in general there is always this air of scarcity of death and starvation. Letting my friends down by not being able to sign a lease in some months isn't a nice thought. Same level, letting my friend down who is really trying to do this video stuff ain't it either."
Single Mothers,2015-05-02 19:01:00,"Women choose who get a chance at reproducing. If a girl chooses not to fuck anyone in a certain group of guys, then those guys will not be passing on their genes. The girl can caste her eggs elsewhere. There are a finite amount of eggs in the world and an infinite amount of sperm. Eggs are therefore more valuable than sperm and should be pursued. And this reaction is what I see all the time. Your mom is perfect and could never do anything wrong. She has no responsibility in choosing a guy she did not fully know. When it comes to things like this, it is your fault if you don't fully vet your partner. If I'm getting a fake ID and I don't fully vet the company or website that is sending me this thing, it is 100% my fault if I get my money stolen. Sure, it's shitty of that company to do that, but it was my choice to bet my money on something I did not fully understand. I will say that, from the inside of dysfunction, dysfunction may be hard to recognize if you do not have self knowledge. Knowing who you are, why you are this way, why you made certain decisions in the past, etc. in the future you are better equipped to judge potential suitors. If you start judging suitors before self-knowledge, it is your fault if the suitor leaves. Instead of staying the duration of the conversation, you left. Why is that? I think that that is cowardly. You can't handle the truth and would rather live in a world where your mom is a perfect saint who brought you into the world and didn't choose the evil man that left you. I get it. It took me awhile to understand that women can be just as at fault for their decisions as men and sometimes even more. More at fault because they brought another life into the world without fully knowing who they were doing this thing with. The same goes for men. But in men's case, the evil woman can trap them with the kid or cheat on them while the kid exists. When the to individuals break up, guess who most likely gets the kids. (clue: the one with the vagina ) Paige - Your father cheated on your mom. I think that that is one of the most inconsiderate evil things to do because his decision extends beyond the bounds of his personal relationship with your mom... his decision spans a generation with you as the victim. So, let me first say that I condemn this activity of his. He did the wrong thing and involving a child makes it worse. I'm so sorry that this happened to you, I really am. and the reason I'm trying to have this conversation with you is to prevent you from befalling the same fate as your mother. I care about you Paige and honestly, through this conversation about feminism, I really think that I got to know you a great deal more. Now the other words. Your mom is at fault too. Your mom picked a guy to fuck, marry, and have a kid with without knowing who he really was. Your mom who I'm sure had many many options if she's even half as pretty as you. Out of all the men that she interacted with, she chose this guy. now I am being intellectually honest here. I'm saying that both individuals are at fault. Since she is the victim here, the only person that your mom can blame for the situation is herself. She was the one that chose him. I'm not denying that he did it. The man should blame himself for choosing to be with a woman who he wasn't going to be fully committed to. And you should view them as equally responsible for the downfall of your family. Holding your mom to this golden standard that she could do no wrong does nothing but disguise the truth in her choice, allowing you to make the exact same decisions in your relationships without seeing the parallel. You are 'talking' to a guy which for all intents and purposes is dating by an old school definition. From what I saw, he mostly cares about you for your vagina and the second something better comes along and apparently did in the case of his formal, he's going to leave you. Is he shitty for that? Yes. Are your equally responsible for the hurt that you are feeling now as a result of his infidelity? Yes. Because you did choose to be in a relationship and sleep with the guy without knowing if he was going to commit or not and without knowing whether he has a value system to sustain a lifelong commitment. Look at the Parallel. Your mom chose a guy. You chose a guy Your mom connected deeply with her guy and fucked him. You connected deeply with your guy and fucked him. Your mom's guy cheated on her. Your guy ditched you for another girl for the biggest frat event that they do every year. Your mom blames her guy for what he did and doesn't take any responsibility for her own choice. You blame all men and your guy for being shitty to girls instead of seeing your choice that is involved. Disclaimer; Connected deeply in this context means had good sexual chemistry and had good conversations that did not involve truth or philosophy. Fucking perfect. Feminists blame all guys for something that some demonized subset of guys do. Literally, men have gone out and killed alleged rapists before the alleged have had a trial. But somehow only men can stop rape. -----This is some older shit that I never got around to publishing------- 4-2-15"

It is not really fun to go out right now. I am just spinning my wheels most of the time. the impact that I am having on the girls around me isn't deep. It's usually fun albeit surface level ending in not much. It is a bit painful. It's exciting but nerve racking. I don't know how I'm going to deal with the new world. Are things going to change? I don't know. I'm casually trying to make my life better but I don't think I'm doing a very good job. There is something where I am a bit afraid of what that upper level looks like.

102-112* thailand escapades,2024-04-08 23:11:00,"102 - met this girl when i was out with raz and some other guys after one of the days of the bangkok affilliat conference. it was at a rooftop bar. good vibes. approached her and her friend and jsut started talking and making jokes. it was vibes from the start. same night pull. we met up one time after that but just to talk if i remember. she was not a good mother from what i remember. had a daughter that she wasn't good at raising and the daughter even threatened to kill her or something. stressful. left during christmas and new years to go on vacation alone. bad behavior. tried to see her when she got back but she had an attitude and didn't like how i was texting her.103 - i went out with guys at suprememedia one of the clients of the bsiness i'm in with raz. cool party with liek 6 people. ended up offending one of the guys girlfriends when the girl made a joke about cum or something that i repeated. he didn't hear her say it but he heard me after and was offended that I would say something like that to his girl. i digress. a couple of those guys took me out to soi cowboy after. went to a full naked bar. after, one of the guys went home, me and the last guy went to a club. right before going in, i just grabbed a nearby girl and told her to come with me. She did. danced with me most of the night. bought her a drink or two. the guy had a hoe whom he'd already fucked. ended up leaving with them to eat at a nearby cafe. had to pay for a bunch of food. thai girls eat a fuckton bro. the guy pulled me to the side and told me what would happen... basically, i would pay for the food, go home with the girl, fuck, and give her money for a taxi in the morning... but give a bit more for the taxi if you know what i mean. and that's exactly what happened. gave her like 1k baht to go home. technically didnt' have change but it was whatever. techically she wasn't a hoe but whatever. didn't see her again despite trying. she just wanted me to go see her at her bar. pretty sure she had a kid somewhere104 - met this youtuber from indo. met her in the street after getting a bottle with my malaysaina friend kee. no clue how we officially met. just ended up dancing with her in front of a chicken truck. she asked me to go home with her. went to their apt. had to do a meeting with weigh anchor after i arrived. fucked her on the couch. really enjoyed that experience. ended up meeting up with her in jakarta. fucked there but i didn't really put in that much effort in the bang. kinda phoned it in. we've talked since, like 3-5 several hour long conversations. she's too busy though and often doesn't respond. I'll probably see her again but it's a fuckin bish. 105 - got this random workers number when i was at sugar and drunk i think. she was way more fat and unattractive than i remembered. still i fucked her on a couple different occasions. not proud of it. broke it off with her evern though she really still tries to reach out. I will say it's more fun to fuck those girls because you can jsut fuck them. disrespect and all. slap, choke, really just give it your all and they love it.had a kid somwhere***106*** fuuuk i almost forgot this girl. holy shit how can i. i met this other girl at lucky club. wild wild girl who i was dancing with at 7am. hottest girl in the club easily. took me some effort to be honest... like she wasn't giving a ton of IOIs initially when i tried dancing with her. then we were together. man this was good game. left lucky at like 7am and went to eat at this kareoke place nearby. i think we were kissing. so good man. i really liked this girl. i pulled to my place buuut i don't think we fucked? just went home almost immediately if i remember. we met up a few nights later at her place. she was way way uglier without her whole getup man. like night and day. turns out she works in soi cowboy. a hoe. her whole family works there. i think she makes 20-35k baht per mo. trash money. gave her like 200 baht for some reason when we met up and she bought some shit food from 7/11 and paid the rest for some slot machine game on her phone. it was a frustrating visit. i was pulling out game but it was pussy bullshit game. like pity shit. like i really like you, why don't you like me or why don't you want to go out on a date or some bullshit. ended up leaving there.i think. i think i ran into her at a club a different night. pulled back ot my place. took actually so much effort. like actually so much but got the bang. she was sexy man. god. anyway she wanted to go to out to lucky after and i didn't want to. i think this activated the hoe part of her that i didn't want to go out with her after we banged and she started asking for money. she started getting loud. fuck. and she called someone to come meet her. so i got nervous and took her to the atm. she asked for 3k but i gave her 1800. just said i literally didn't have any more. eventually she gave up and left. it was embarrassing and annoying. i was honestly kinda pissed about it. like i'm okay with paying probably but this shit where i have to punch out legit game for multiple nights to pay for a hoe is bullshit. just come out with the shit from jump and niggas can make decisions dafuck. anyway, blocked her from there. i did actually like her outgoing personality version. like actually. she was so fun and also completely non-jealous. like it was truly a pleasure going out with her man. lol can't believe i almost forgot her. literally writing this after completing the post... i don't even really know where she fits in with the girls.. whatever.107 - super super slim girl from lucky club. met on one of the nights i was going out with zammy. suuuper cute at night. less cute in the day. probably the most attractive girl ive banged in thailand. very nice body, okay pussy. i saw her again out a few times but she's a bar girl. she's not interested in a relationship or really anything normal. met her again accidentally at sugar but she was way too drunk and i felt bad for her. didn't want to fuck again. she also had a kid somewhere108 - met this girl from myanmar at dope and dirty one night (candy.clover on ig) we met up once and did a mini date thing at jodd fair. she has a busines there doing nails. her worker did my nails. good experience. no sex that night, maybe a kiss on the cheek to leave. met up like a month or several weeks later after she came back from myanmar. she stayed the night at my place and we banged. it took a lot of effort. i was really pushing but we got the bang. she had a lot of acne all over her body. not super attractive but cute face girl. didn't meet up again because she asked for like 3k baht and i don't usually give money out to random people anymore even if we've hooked up. like especially under threat of payin or not paying back. like i probably would have given it to her if she would have finessed but as it was direct, nah. i guess i've just been burned a bit too much. also 3k was a lot at the time. so anyway that deaded109 - met this russian after sugar club one night. i was takign this thai dude out to learn how to pick up girls. he did amazing. i left and came back to sugar and took him to the after party at lucky club. when we were walking out, a girl named reggie approached me/us and we took her to lucky. i didn't especially like her but she was good practice for my boy and she was down for anything. I had him dancing with her and doing the most but yknow, no way man is going to close first night in the game. met up with reggie at a saxipohone bar like a week later. the guy hasn't messaged me but whatever. well actually timeline is fuzzy here. i know i met up with her like 2-4 times before we banged. she was recently kinda still in but leaving a long distance relationship. took a lot of effort but we finally banged. context was she came into my apr - she knew how to get in without a key card and got into my bed without clothes on. and of course, i got active. i remember i was sick as shit but not too sick for pussy. She indeed has a great ass and body. decent pussy, nothing special, nothing bad. we fucked like a few weeks later when she got back from canada. even that was a bit of effort. had to really foreplay the shit out of that. i don't think we'll bang again but who knows. I don't really want to but whatever, not going to really say no if she texts me. she's a butterface. god if she was prettier it would be a perfect situation110 - met this thick girl at the black club in pattaya. turned out to be a freelancer. this girl was deliciously thick holy shit. holy shit. so nice dancing with her. anyway, venue changed with her and her friends. ended up tellign me she was a freelancer and the second bar. i left, talked with some other girl or failed at some gutter game and came back to pull her. was fun. costed 2k baht. still kinda had to foreplay her into sex. she liked it though. she really wanted ot keep banging. took every chance. didn't like that i was sick but ignored it for the bang. i was sick as a fucking dog man - almost couldn't breath laying there. almost met up again when she came to bangkok a couple weeks later but never happened. most times these days it's just hard to have teh motivation to bang. like why would we bang. like i like sex but lord it's effort. like the foreplay is really a lot of work if you don't really like the girl. truly it's too much and I can suffer it if i need pussy but holy shit is it a fucking chore. like that's the main reason i probably won't fuck reggie again... like i'm not dealing with you coming over and then telling me you're not fucking. like the fucking whole goddamn purpose in you coming over is pussy. your existence to me is pussy and the audacity thatyou have to come and think that i would just want to spend time with you for the love of the game is flabbergasting. of course, things i've said may have led to that belief but i digress. we have to sell a dream or two to get placesanyway didn't bang the thick girl again. also specifically, she was deliciously thick. can't stress that enough. like not fat, just thick as shit. i think she's fucked like 20*24 amount of men and i fucked no condom. animal behavior.has a kid somewehre111 - brown girl from bangladesh. men from bumble probalby. met at a local bar, propaganda. vibe okay. went to get weed from weed shop and smoked at my place. she kinda came onto me. banged - not too difficult. not bad bang but body wasn't where it needed to be. like she had a phat phat ass but i mean also a stomach and was mid overall. i had the chance to bang again but passed. don't think i'll pull that one off again. not good enough112 - apriltime, pulled girl while walking home from meeting raz and eugene. in front of bts by emquariter. just the normal approach but she was too down from jump. instant date to xscape because she left her phone there. got one drink. she's apparantly a pro matchmaker. said i needed to do work so needed to go home but we could get a drink there. she agreed - walked back. was a bit of a grind to get somewhere.. honestly didnt' think i was going to be able to pull it off - it was a whole david bond pull. like i pulled up some yt videos and she sat on my lap while we watched. then we pulled up some of her old videos and laughed and cringed at young her. was rubbing her pussy almost the whole time but still wasn't getting anywhere. started kissing and then ate her out for awhile. allegedly she came and then asked if i had a condom. bam. fun bang. but this is where we have a conversationI can't cum anymore with a condom. it's gotta be raw for me to feel something. now.. have i been able to get off w a condom... yes. i think the last time i fucked the youtuber it was pure condom and i came in that bish. feels so good. like if i haven't fucked or masterbated in a week, sure, we can get one off with a condom and one off without. never ever ever, am i getting two nuts off with a condom. simply isn't happening. we'd have to do some bdsm or some fuck shit to get there bruv. So it's a problem.right before reggie, i had a sore on my dick. it could have been an ingrown hair but maaan it had all of the hallmarks of herpes and it just wouldn't fucking go away. like holy shit. and let me say, with the exception of probably the indo girl, i was raw with every girl on this list. even the whores and the bar girls. like man i have a deathwish or somethinglike i think the main thing is that my body and mind are still in this zone where i'm fucking random white girls with under 5 bodies in the states where the risk of anything is fucking nothing and i haven't changed my ideas for these women. also i'm not sure why i'm just simply unafraid of precum and having a kind but i'm simply unafraid of precum and having a kid. irrational probably. the sore went away thank god but i still haven't been tested. need to do that probably before i go back to the states. but bad behavior.also i love that i'm complaining about not being able to pick up women out here and here i am, fuckin cracking off and having a top 3 semester of my lift. like casually. that the fuck man. fall 2018 and fall 2019 were the only seasons where i was matched. i'm gearing up for a record year.and yet pussy is sooooo fucking unserious and unimportant to me and i can't explain how little i care about a fuck now. like i'd rather not most of the time, especially if it's a repeat. need to raise the caliber of my fucks."
i feel naked,2023-03-02 05:14:00,"when talking with someone you don't know... i mean i feel naked especially when sharing something that I haven't really shared with anyone else. I feel like i could and maybe should be judged for the ideas. It's weird. whatever tho. especially with women, whom I have communicating with. lord. I just don't like it in the least. The only girl I've ever enjoyed communicating with was Lisa. Everyone else was a show."
30 on June 30 - Refine my last post,2017-07-05 13:20:00,"Anna Briggs - maybe works at outdoor voices in NY (@nabriggs instagram) I've fucked 30 women. Some hippie girl stopped me while I was sleeping in my car and basically asked me out. She was walking her friend's great dane-mastiff mutt and dicided to chat me up. She drove me down to the Burlington Docks and bought me 2 Creemees (Vermont's verson of soft serve ice cream). Then we walked around and talked about different shit for the better part of an hour or two. We then drove and fucked in an empty parking lot in the back of her 2007 Chevy Equinox. Hairiest vagina yet. She too was on her period.The condom broke and I came inside her though she didn't notice. It only lasted a minute or two with my excuse to dip being that here was only one condom. She even mentioned going to buy more, but I was very over it. Anywho. Women in general. I am typing this in the middle of my work day. GE Aviation Rutland. I can't get my mind off of Anna Brigs and 14-year-old Rashida Jones. Anna's last words to me that I need to learn a lesson and how to coordinate meeting Rashida Jones in the future and sustaining that relationship since she lives and works in Connecticut. The Rashida Jones situation seems like somehting that I'll have to finagle as a short term fun deal with more investment than I normally demand from girls. The former is a reflection of all my fears re-culminated in the purest form of rejection. I became this man. I am not innocent. Embarking on this journey, I thought that it would be possible to trick girls of virtue into liking me regardless of my body count and tendencies toward debauchery (the first culmination was around Vida but I never explicitly shot my shot and she never explicitly denied, though an implied rejection could be inferred). But, just like all 'tells' in lying and body language, if you try to hide one, another always appears to betray the truth about your person. I've been going for pussy for so long that my actions body language and words eventually betray my intentions and it is up to the girl whether to continue or not. This girl was no different. I will not get this type of girl for as long as this superficial short term goal is all that I have in my mind. Again, this is the type of shit that distracts me from my work. The second I reenter the game, here I am wasting work time. Here I am, unable to focus solely on the tasks at hand until these situations are resolved or forgotten. I hate it. I hate not being able to focus or having to explicitly close off part of my mind and memory in order to survive the day. The next few days will be hard since I have to live through the consequential emptiness brought to me by what I am hereby coining as the 'Anna-Briggs Decision'. This decision will hereby be defined as any decision that would be defined as disrespectful or inappropriate regardless of the subject. This means that although an Anna-Briggs Decision might still lead to success in the form of sex or a phone number, the pseudo-objective reality of the situation is that if done to a virtuous conservative girl, success would not be likely. I need to recognize Anna-Briggs Decisions as then come on in the same way that we recognize nigga moments and head them off in the same way. They are irrational spurts of energy. Remember: if you don't have relationships with women, you don't get distracted at work. Your life is less complicated. Your life has less risk. You are generally happier. I can imagine a situation in which a girl could yield a happier life. I just haven't ever experienced this imagined situation there yet. Other's experiences tell me that I should still hold out hope and continue to act in order to have this experience. I said I would quit. I need to quit. I just really really want to have something. I want to do the relationship thing for a few weeks. Lord Chi, let this relationship happen for a few weeks. Then decide on your future. Hold out hope. Hold up some bar. I will be going through some articles on unconscious self-sabotage and Freud's theory on that as well as some preliminary conclusions on existentialism in my next post. Stay strong till then."
well well well,2023-08-10 22:06:00,"I'm here. I'm not doing bad - just feeling a bit down.I want to talk to more women. I really would like a relationship or some sex. I miss intimacy. I really really miss it. I miss my room being organized even though I don't really feel a connection to the space. I could walk away from all of that stuff and not really care or think twice about what I left behind. Maybe m time in fashion is over. But if that's the case then, what now. But that has been the question for awhile. I feel a thirst. My desire to go back abroad is in pursuit of adventure but also and probably mostly sex and intimacy. It was just easier for me to get that elsewhere. It feels like American women are moving past me - that or I'm regressing. I think it's more the latter. I moved from houly jobs (trading time for money objectively) to corporate jobs where there was at least some kind of asymmetric relationship. Then and now I'm back to a super hourly agressive workflow where I'm averaging something like 25/h but working 80 hours to get some thing special out of that. Wild.The sweet hell of styding in school - dare I say it I miss it. I reminisce a lot. I remember a lot.What is my life now man - It feels like the best days are even behind me. I'm old. There's a girl standing outside of the window at the Panera I'm sitting in. She's cute. Black shirt- Fanny pack, wearing biker shorts. Reminds me of the girl who I met that was a photographer in Moscow. I miss even her even though there didn't seem to be that much of a connection. I want to go masturbate in the bathroom but I'm not going to. It's been a week or so since I last masturbated. I don't konw why I'm choosing not to. I think I want some semblance of hope in life. I imagine that this is some magic pill that, if I get too full up, will push me overboard into actoin. In reality, it seems, I'm just more pent up and when I do meet a girl who kinda shows some amount of interest I just have the absolute hardest rocket of a shaft possible for the entiretly of the interaction.I'm starved. And so what. Man I'm so far ahead of where I was a year ago. I actually have a platform to make money (uber). I have a car and an apartment. I have friends. I don't have girls but that's normal I guess. I feel weak. but life is allegedly good."
debating liberals,2015-10-29 05:19:00,"My post today will be a combination of a lot of topics since I have not posted on here in awhile. first I would like to comment on my recent debate/discussion with a couple liberal friends of mine. I'm se tempted to just cut off contact with such individuals simply because of their views. They are so irrational and show a staggering inability to investigate or think. They don't know one word about what their candidate stands for nor do they use anything other than emotion to argue. The first thing Ii would like to talk about is what would happen to poor people in the absense of the state. That is the only question that they brought up multiple times.Are you going to let all of the poor people die. This is the problem with utilitarianism. It justifies immoral actions be dine in the pursuit of the alleged greater good. It all comes back to the shit I used to argue back when I was on the debate team. I think I might try and rejoin next year. But. The evil shit that has been justified in the name of the greater good is uncountable. millions, nay, billions of people have died in the name of the so-called greater good. really. one billion people had to die so that the rest of us could live. really. one million people had to be tortured and killed so that you could live. Are we really going to widdle it down to that. You can literally justify anything then in the name of your own life or in this case the lives of poor people. So you're okay with stealing from people for the alleged greater good. What about rape? what about murder? what about murder? what about jailing whistleblowers? The only way to live a moral an consistent life is to live by principles. otherwise you will end up doing some truly evil shit. like the american government does everyday. did you know not a couple weeks ago, the US government bombed a doctors without borders hospital in the middle east? a hospital. a motherfucking hospital. a mutherfucking goddamn hospital. That is where we are at now. But these liberal idiots don't know. pisses me off everytime. Another thing. you don't have the money to pay for these poor people. you literally just don't have. the money. you don't have the money. you are in debt and the proposals put on the desk by democrats are that we should spend more on more stuff. we should spend more. we should spend more. WITH WHAT MONEY we are trillions of dollars in debt. you cannot buy shit that you can't afford. and at this point our credit is shit too so we can't even pay these people on credit. I mean fuck while we are in the business of paying poor people with printed money, why don't we just buy them all lamborghinis and houses in the hollywood hills? why don't we just pave all the roads with gold and silver and fund ever single science proposal? why don't we just let the other 2/3 of mexico into america? Fuck that, why don't we just open out borders and pay everyone who wants a lamborghini or a new home? liberals are idiots. they are ignorant and talking with them is very annoying The reason I do it is the same reason that I argue with christians. Maybe I'll reach one person. Maybe I'll give one person hope. Maybe my presence will be there for the one guy or girl that is doubting or wondering if he or she is alone in his or her beliefs. My next post I will try a lot harder to use all of the correct grammar and punctuation. I will try to capitalize every word at the beginning of every sentence. It is a tiny bit annoying and contradictory of me to call a whole group of people idiots while using incorrect grammar and not capitalizing all of the right words in my polemic. Maybe. of maybe not because no one will probably ever see this while I'm alive... so fuck it this is for my therapeutic and inventive measures only. anyway. how is my search for females going? not evil. a couple girls reached out to me from my past via text yesterday. That was a wonderful surprise albeit not fruitful. I might go to Baltimore in the upcoming weeks to visit the one but we will see what happens. I think that I will try to ask her out on a froyo date and go try to have sex after. Or just gauge the sex part for after the froyo. SHIT I forgot to get on here and talk about the last time I had sex. I hated it. I mean the actual sex was the normal just like all of the other times. But I distinctly remember during the sex, thinking what is the pint. Is this really the culmination of all of my try hardness over the summer. Would I feel a lot better if this girl was more beautiful? probably not i don't think. But actually maybe because it felt pretty good fucking that girl in baltimore. it would have been better if i had been able to fuck her again though. I would have liked that a lot better. I desperately want to be part of something larger and now I am afraid that I don not have the ability. This is very similar to when I thought that I didn't have an ability to get girls. Three years later I am about 8 girls deep. Not a great number but I consider it a success given my initial mission. I dove into the endeavor and figured myself out and figured women out for a few moments there. Now I have found a distinct short coming of mind that I again feel the distinct need to address. A NEED to address. I learned a lot in the years that I devoted to learning how to do game. Now it is time for me to learn how to be in a relationship. So I think that that is what I will go for in the upcoming years and after said relationship, decide what I want to go for for my life or for the next few years after that. who knows maybe then there will be another inconsistency or shortcoming that will show itself through my daily movements or thought the therapy that I am about to undertake. ttyl"
Play by play = shit got me fucked up,2017-02-14 01:45:00,"A review of the various posts available will show that they days where there is a play by play of the interaction that I am having with a girl, she got me caught up. Look at me. Look at me. This is embarrassing. Sending multiple messages in a row. Taking 10 minutes to actively respond. Look. I want to think that she is different. I want to think that she is special and that her specialness allows for some fuckups. I know that game is messy. I know that there are few nights and situations where the pickup is beautiful, textbook and clean. But she is really not different. CHI. FUCKING LISTEN. YOU REALLY NEED TO YEAR THIS SHIT. She is not different than the women that you met today. She is not different than Daria. She is not different than the Norwegian you met in Estonia. She is not different than the executive you met at the kids club in Cincinnati. She is not even much different than you. I can smell the neediness. I can taste it. It has destroyed me so many times and here he is again. No matter how many self-help books, Tyler Durden videos, infield demonstrations, in field tests, or reference experiences I get, if I get caught up, I am no better than the little Chi that set out at 19 to change his life. This will be me anytime and every time I decide to get caught up. Read these next sentences carefully. This will be you if you ever decide to treat a girl differently than you have treated every single girl before her. This will be you and this will be your loss. She isn't different. Don't treat her differently. Live like she is just another hoe that could drop your line. The fact of the matter is that she is just another girl that could drop you. Mate, she is in your phone with a sad face, a Z on her last name, and an NTA on the middle. She has already done this to you. Don't you dare think that because you are prettier and more confident now that you are above good game. Don't ever think that you can just not be sexy. Don't ever think that you can just take off her clothes without foreplay, without being in the moment, or without not speaking and breaking the sexual tension because you are uncomfortable with your ability to perform. Tread lightly fuckboy. p.s. she did respond but you really do need to chill my friend. You didn't like it when Becky liked you too much so don't be out here like that."
the day after,2016-11-20 22:07:00,"Hello brother I made it. I am on the other side of the night. Maybe since I am past it I can think clearly about my actions and what took place. I am currently sitting in the University or Charleston’s green grounds behinds it’s library. There are many opportunities for daygame if I so chose to participate. Of course I don’t want to. More because I don’t want to confront the anxiety that harbors the middle ground between standing and the female I’ve chosen than an actual lack of want of the interaction. I do very much enjoy the feeling of my fingers gliding over these keys in the same way water flows over rocks in a babbling brook. I’d like to stay here. I’d like to stay here for hours and decide whether or not I want to speak to these females or not and when I finally ball up, I’d like to live in that moment of sunshine and acceptance. My computer is almost dead so I might have to walk back to my car to retrieve my charger so that I can continue my writing. So. The day after. My one and only issue is breaking through the first wall that is separating me from action. That’s it. I know all the other rules for game. Down talk, teasing, frame control, ignoring certain questions to maintain the frame, being real sometimes, entertaining the crowd at other times. I’m a real life real crowd pleaser when I need to be. Once I begin, there is nothing that can stop me. Except people leaving me. What I have found is that if I keep a kind of talisman with that represents the litness that I have already conjured, I’m fine. I can pivot to another group. The issue comes when the first or second group of dudes or girls moves along without me. I then find myself lost in the moment of inaction for a few seconds nothing is happening. A few seconds turns into an extremely uncomfortable two minutes and then you end up walking back to the far to change clothes because doing so is a solid excuse to start over from scratch with the whole night. Once you’re in that ditch it is almost impossible to claw out. My extrovertism is driven by the personal interactions and when the personal interactions lull, I go deeper into the lake of my soul. I stop existing in the real world. Also, this school is all females. Which is absurd. The trick might be, if there is ever a choice between the women and the guys, choose the men. Bros before hoes. The reason being these hoes are fickle and if you aren’t successful, the lull in action might take place. With other dudes on the other hand, there is no lull in action. There is only lit. There is only approaching, talking, rejection and the restart. I can teach, I can demonstrate my value to the group, I can be accepted and join the party, then become their party, then end the night at such a high level that it goes down in my book as the greatest. That is the progression and that is that with which I strive for. I am not out here for the women. I mean I am but on a different level I am not. I am here for the culture. I am here to be the change I want to see in the world. I am here to empower men to take chances and do things that scare them. If you need that extra motivation, those extra words of comfort before action, I got you. I got you my dawg. I like that. I appreciate that call or text asking for advice, motivation, etc exponentially more than the girl actually texting the number I give her. #fortheculture"
death sounded reeeeaallll good today,2021-03-27 23:10:00,"I tied for the last time to get out of the marriage thing today. she started crying, started making me feel bad and then I gave up and agreed to continueI am not the same guy who started all this shit. I am a shell. a fake performative shell of a man that can't stand up for what he wants in the face of almighty unreason.I layed in be for the whole day because I can't imagine anything else but dying after that bullshit. Fuck life. literally whats the fucking point. I am tired of it all. I really am. I would like to go peacefully and quietly. I think it waill be a bottle or two of advil (two just to make sure it goes). I'll take a flight to a third world country and go out to the middle of no where and finish it. If someone ever finds my body, they'll have no idea who the fuck I am or who to call. I'll wait until i move out of my parents house. If I don't answer the phone when family calls, they'll think it's normal and probably won't think to try and look for me till chistmas or my birthday, if ever.it'd be easy to get out of here without much drama. I'd like that. I thought about leaving a youtube video to publish in a couple years to explain to people what happened but god knows not many people would find it. I'm tired.I'm weak. I don't have purpose and I don't enjoy things. Why continue like this."
madina,2023-02-14 04:01:00,"i keep thinking about her. i miss her. i don't know what she is doing or where she is but dam. her and daniella. two beautiful souls. i miss companionship, spending time with girls with and without an agenda. this press towards doing something with life is taxing.i don't like it. i miss flowing with the waves, swimming against when necessary but floating generally nonetheless. i don't have bunches of cash - i just want to do the things that i want to do. asking for money from people is the bane of my existence. what else. i mean i want to sleep lol. i have so many creations now, i almost can't handle anymore... but still more will be created."
what the fuck do I want to do,2020-01-20 05:48:00,"g0ddamn hi hello mother fucker. I hope you are doing well. I haven't third person'ed in awhile. So, here we are. I will make a list for no reason other than to procrastinate on the things that I should be doing to better myself. 1) become a dj or musicmaker Why - mostly because I want the additional fame but also it would be cool to be able to express my thoughts in a cool way through this medium. but mostly for the fame. This job could lead to the life that I'm after though it would require a grind 2) become a programmer Why - mostly for the money and the potential mobility that this job would provide. eventually this job could lead to the lifestyle I'm after. 3) keep on being a teacher Why - because it's a job I can do right now that will allow me the freedom to travel, the freedom ot use my personality, and the freedom to live the lifestyle that I want right now aaaaaaand that's it. I could go back to school and do some other shit but that would mean that I couldn't work in the part of the world that I want to live and work in (right now). I had an argument with my dad today about nothing - i think he wanted to air out the bigger disagreement that we have in that I think that life should be enjoyed everyday and he thinks that a person has to or should sacrifice time to get the things that they want. And he is correct - in order to get the things that I want, I have to spend time learning russian, learning how to program, learning how to dj and learning how to teach. the disagreement is that he doesn't see any goal or path to wealth, financial stability or family planning in my scheme - he only sees things through the american business perspective and I'm only planning things out one step and year at a time. I have to learn russian. that is number one. secondary, i have to learn programming or djing - probably both but damn time managment is shit most of the time. I should figure out a way to get to sams club at 4am without needing a ride - just checked, it's a 2 hour walk. doable bye motherfucker - you been known what to do - you just need to actually do the shit. here's a goal how about you go for 40 hours towards your other shit next week - i mean russian while you eat, russian during your breaks - 2 hours of russian each day, one speaking to the girl, one speaking to the guys. really do this thing. bye"
moving on,2021-06-07 18:19:00,"i tell you man. moving on from people sucks. I have made so many posts about this but i have to make another. it's truly the worst part of life that people die and relationships end. it's the best and worst. I'm holding on. I can see that. I'm holding on to Mary. it hurts to let her go. i'm holding on to a lot of people. I would ask what is the difference between holding on and maintaining relationships that are important to you? I would tell you that it's self evident. When the other person has stopped putting in any effort in communication to the point of not answering a message and not following or engaging with your social media, that's the time when you're holding on to something that doesn't exist anymore. memories are beautiful. if you need, go back and see those. but as far as the future goes, know that you're watering a dead plant. god though it would be nice if it just came back alive. I know it can't but god that would be nice.she's moving on. we've went over this a thousand times. no matter to me. I will still probably send her a note on her birthday. maybe a video maybe a simple text. it might be the last effort. though i'll say if i feel the tug i'll still reach out. as it stands though, i feel that i need to let her go. just breath, focus and be at peace."
i'm feeling the pain of all my mistakes,2023-03-06 23:04:00,"my life is bleeding. i have nothing and my life is bleeding out. it feels impossible to stop the flow. at this rate, I'll be dead by may. for the first time, really truly I don't know what to do. i know things I can do but I don't know what to do. I'm considering quitting for the first time. lol I mean not for the first time but considering a nice life quit right about now. lord. what is there for me out in these streets now. i don't know. to be a hoe again? for what?I just hate that girls and businesses get my hopes up for the future only to be returned bleeding a little bit more and with a little less faith to the place I started or worse.IM BLEEDING.SOMEONE PLEASE HELP FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKbut no one is coming. no one is coming. life can end any minute now. any moment. any moment could be my last. feels calming to some extent. annoying. i want to speed up and end things. end the potential. end what could be. end the hell with daydreams built on top.wait...wait. wait wait.am I catching a break at this very moment at 4pm on 3/6/23she messaged me shes sending the contract now. but that means I'll have to follow through with this. i have to be a worker. which isn't the worst thing but. we outside tho."
on alcohol and my growth,2017-01-01 16:22:00,"It is 2017! New year same Chi. I have grown so much in 2017. New years is the measure of how much I have added to my person. I can basically join any group of guys and most groups of guys and girls and even a few groups of girls and get all of them to love me. I am exhausted at the end of every night and I did run out of things to say several times tonight. This makes me think that I am spending a lot of energy acting. When I say acting I mean being more than pretending to be someone else. I am being the lit version of Chi. It is exhausting. Once I am fully on which has only happened a few times this year, nothing can stop me. I did notice something. Some part of my body wants a relationship. I know I have written already that I want one but now it is really starting to show with my game and who I am choosing to be near. I end up kissing and loving on a girl like she is my girlfriend, instead of kissing her and fucking her like the one night stand that it is. That is how come I am having so much LMR at the end of the last few sets. I felt this wave of my evo coming back in new york and now I think it is finally here. I am trying so hard to be a boyfriend. In 2017, what do I want to do? I want to keep working out for sure. Get a nice routine going everyday. I can become someone else. I can fully od the nerd Chi bullshit in order to become the person I want to be. I really want to be a bartender abroad in budapest or paris or ibiza or some other crazy place. That or work at a hostel or just do any odd job for a few months as a break to the corporate grind that I am taking part in. In 2017, I will learn Russian. Gamewise, I don't know what else there is. 3some with 2 girls, higher than a 3some, 3 way kiss, fucking in a club, girls from different countries. These are all things to do but I'm just kinda over nightgame for now. I think from here on I will work way harder on my daygame. The quality of girls are better and it gives me way more of a high. Direct daygame is where Chi as we know him was created. I don't know what else to say. My brain is blank. budapest is lit. In 2017, I will become proficient in west coast swing. that's all for today."
the last wedding of the season,2018-10-21 20:00:00,"I was the best server. I was the most entertaining server person that people had ever interacted with. And it didn't even take that much energy. It was my normal shit. I loved that wedding. It definitely wasn't my best but it was in my top 3 from a dance move perspective and from a polarizing impact perspective. There were people there that absolutely loved me and there were others who probably didn't care too much for Chi, namely the girl who I told that I would have hated her when we were both 10. There's a lot that I could work on though. It was interesting bouncing the girl home that Saturday night juxtaposed with the game the way it is now. There is something about being in the presence of someone who is great and taking that energy with you. Generating it for yourself is one of the most difficult parts of the streets and even harder to teach. I went out with some guys last this Friday... 4 dudes from the inner circle chat and the first thing that I noticed is that they weren't approaching. One of the things that I wanted out of this was to be around people that were equal or more motivated to pull up than myself. I wanted that as a shortcut to generating that energy on my own to approach. There is still some part of my brain that wants that shortcut in will where I can just be near someone else and have them pull me up with them instead of how it literally always is where I'm having to pull everyone else up. If someone is to hang out with me, I have to grab them and carry them up the hill if I want them to participate on the level that I am at. On of the more annoying things about all that is that even by acting with intent and beauty, motherfuckers will still distill everything that you are doing down to looks or skin color or some other immutable characteristic that they don't have. Just tragic and also annoying. How can I teach or inspire when people are so low in their energy. I empathize with what the RSD guy told me over the phone during the sales call the other day. He said that RSDTyler has a lot of trouble empathizing with some of the guys that are at that super low level so he has coaches that teach and interact with most of the students, kids that are able to closer engage with that energy since in most circumstances, they were in that situation more recently. I empathize with that more after that recent experience and even now watching those dated Simple Pickup boot camp videos. It is uncomfortable watching this grown man approach these girls in Hollywood and fail so miserably. That being said, most of that would probably happen to me since I care way too much a lot of the time. There was a small period when I was in Baltimore, that shit I talk about all the time, where I truly believed everything that came out of my mouth and I could preach it and do it at the same time. I fully understood that the men that I was with would mostly not be able to engage on the level that I was engaging on and I was okay with that . We were all bad and figuring this shit out. I am now for some reason expecting myself to be good in the presence of such bad energy and that is not a reasonable expectation. There were certain things that I used to do that were inherently needy that were needed for me to excel in my bullshit. I needed to get over myself. I needed to destroy every excuse in my puny little brain that there was to not go talk to a girl. I pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant, I literally ran after bitches and surprised them to get a number close, I approached old Russian women on the inner harbor for the chance at something. absolute bullshit. But I showed regularly that there is never a reason to not go over somewhere. The next level? Coaching these men with the knowledge that I have to be the progenitor of information, I have to be the boss and I have to give direction or everyone will fail and stagnate. Yeah, dude it's time to grow up and actually be a leader. If you want to take that shit to the next level, you have to take charge."
what do you want,2022-10-14 03:51:00,"that reallly is the infinite question. I still don't really care all that much. I started this week out strong with the completion of a few sewing projects but that has faded this week.One reason is that there is less excitement to redo the things that I have already done. I like the novelty of doing something else, something new. The older things, even through I may be improving in them, don't give me much. I don't care.I'm going to really need to reset my dopamine levels... I don't know how that is possible with as much adventure and technology I have around me. Like even if I leave and get out in nature there is still a level of adventure to that activity that will put me into a place where I am in enjoyment. I really need to suffer boredom with no solution other than rote tasks that I can slightly improve on month by month. I don't know if I can or will ever or even want to ever banish myself to that level of the shadow realm. I want it but not really just like everything else in this life. Alas, i have responsibilities. Responsibilities truly are the only thing keeping me alive on any level at this point. I would just drift away to nothingness if these weren't a thing. I'm not sad. I'm just tired. always and forever tired lmao"
lol i think i like it,2025-01-29 08:20:00,"i like the bs with heri actually think i like it. it's fucked i know. i remember mary used to say this thing about my emotional rollercoaster. and it's a fucking ride. it's fucked but i like it. i get so riled up and righteous. i never get to be so correct against an immovable force. it's like fighting my childhood. it's fighting against every single thing that women exist as. it's arguing with the definition of interacting witha modern woman. and i think i love it. i caveat it bacause i don't konw for sure. but the evidence is there. even now, the energy is down and i want to talk to her again. i want to interact and hear her probalby say sorry and probably go back to doing the same shit that she was doing before which was recieving my adoration and time and effort and providing existence in return. how interesting. i wonder if i should do something about it. i wonder if this is a dynamic that i want to keep or something that i want ot work against and have a standard. in the end i will be alone. but the girl is caring and nice. she is smart and she does have porential. we cna dirve each other to the moon. but this shit about secrets man. this hyper unbalance in reciprocity is fucking agonizingly out of wack it's retarded. it's actually retarded and no healthy reasonable person would stand for it. but as healthy or reasonable a si might think that i am, i deeply deeply hate myself. and so in the end, i will tolerate anything because truly i don't deserve better."
where's chi,2015-08-20 04:57:00,"haha it seems like its that timer of the month again. the i\time when chi crashes and gives way to cheez and chibuzor. the time when the boss goes on vacation somewhere leaving the kids alone to fend for themselves literally this is a fucking trend. every few weeks Chi leaves. no one knows why. but here I will try to figure it out. I have realized that I have no clue how to prolong and sustain a relationship with a woman. Literally, have no idea. It's a weird and scary feeling seeing as I do want kids with a unicorn someday. Never have I ever taken a girl on more than 2-3 dates. Never have I ever had sex with a girl for more than 3 times. I don't know what to talk about after awhile. And to top it all off, if I act my normal self, chase the girl, and prove to her that I am special, then she will make me work for it (work for the pussy). I don't know how I feel about that. On the one hand, I welcome the challenge and see it as a sign of potential good girl inside. On the other hand, it's bullshit because other guys get in and out and never hear a sound. All these other dudes fuck and leave with out 2 thoughts but, if I ride in on my programmed stallion to save, I'm the one that has to wait. The good guy has to wait. So, now, as of some minutes ago, I am trying to get into the game of having women chase me. It's so oxymoronic to think that I still have to approach, stop them, and be a cool fun guy, while at the same time not trying and letting the girl chase me, while at the same time not revealing too much or any real information about myself, while at the same time being a boss. I don't know. There's so many frames and things to think about and do. I need to do consistent down talk and become a lot more nonreactive. But really, in the end, are all girls really this way? Yes. Yep. If I have learned nothing in these past few years, it's that all these girls are the same. LITERALLY IF AT ANY TIME THE THOUGHT goes through my head that, ""Hey this might be the one or this one might be different"", I need a firm slap to the face. I need to be plunged into the arctic sea and left for 20 minutes to reevaluate what just went through my mind with the experiences that have gotten me here. This game and girl shit really takes it out of me. Maybe I just need to recharge and do some daygame and chill for awhile. I need to practice this not letting the girl get to know me at all and letting my personality show instead of my resume. Show my personality not my resume. Also, I am going to go after Erica with everything. The next time I see her, I will talk to her and do what I should have done from the beginning of the year. but somehow leave it to her to pursue me??... yeah that's what I'll try to do. I need to find my chi again. (lol)"
a friend with a benefit,2017-10-13 16:50:00,"I am somehow still conversating with Cassidy. I feel dead about it though. Every time I take an action, I run it through my pre-frontal lobe processing unit which decides what the most likely reaction from her should be to my actions based on my current and past experiences and knowledge of her gender. The processing unit has been coming up with negative shit left and right. I don't know if it is a problem with the unit or if this sensor is an accurate reflection of the reality that I am creating. In my mind, it is only a matter of time before this thing dies. The processing unit predicts sooner than later e.g. in the next couple weeks. I have a friend with a benefit: we kissed a couple times. This is the setup for what Olivia did to me. This is the exact same pitch and I'm scared that it'll end in the exact same curve (lol see what I did there). I've retreated. I've reverted to plain Jane niceness. Anything further and I risk killing that benefit outright. Soon, I'm going to try to go and re-negotiate my contract to turn this into a full-fledged range of benefits. But with this shit, I am alone out on the ice. I don't know which way to go or what to do with this broad. All I know is is that I'm here and I'm feeling shit reminiscent of past heartaches. The difference is I'm grown now. No matter how much a grown and complain about this, I know how to handle it. I know how to bounce back. Good luck broski. Don't get too sucked in to this."
the hermit,2022-01-05 22:48:00,"I see who I'm becoming. It's interesting that at the time in my life when theoretically, I want to have the most human contact and the most amount of networking I am heavily resistant to online dating. Theoretically, it could be a relatively easy way to meet likeminded people, specifically women, and fraternize. The same with in person meetings. That said, every flake makes me lean away. I feel that I should just invest heavily in not doing this with people because I'm just not doing this with people. Normal people don't want to partake in activities like this. It just is what it is. It saddens me to see the world like this but it is what it is. I must push away from the dock, no wetsuit on my paddle board onto the lake in the dead of winter. It's cold but I will survive. I must survive."
"paris post 1: holy shit, I am abroad. this is a big fucking update",2016-12-22 13:38:00,"I have no idea what to talk about first. There is so much that I have thought about and done that to begin to describe and put my thoughts down on paper feels like tomfoolery. But here I am trying. Here we o. First, I keeps defaulting to a french accent to speak english. I think the reason is that once I introduce myself in french, bonjour, my brain has a hard time switching back to speaking english without the same mouth formation that I spoke the previous word. I also think that the parisiennes will understand more if I use their accent. French girls. Girls in Paris. Girls tonight. I want to title this blog post something different but I have not done enough. I have not gone out and experienced what all french girls are like. I have avoided daygame as much as possible as I do in the states. I am night game only and even then only certain nights. I was on by the end of the night but really I need to get used to getting rejected again. I think hanging out with Tom Keen will help because I don't want to disappoint him and his god style game. Alo, today I met Tom Keen. From the blacklist. At least a guy who looks just like him and speaks the same plus 4 languages and has the same master game. He was making out with a parisienne girl after 5 minutes of dancing. I was standing there thinking damn. I have done that before but somehow this guy is doing it nonchalantly. My game. These guys are operating on a different level than me they have internalized the rules of game. They understand, whether they know it or not, how to pump their own state and put the girl in it. They understand the idea of social capital and how it must be built in order to accomplish things with women. Most of these lessons I now realize are build in to us to understand. I am just so analytical that I still struggle. Even, I understand the concept but acting it out is now the struggle. I gave up and let him have the last girl of the night. Even though I opened her and found out the information that she needed a place to stay tonight. Why did I do that? My rationalizations are thus: 1) I want to make a permanent friend. I will not have someone to travel with so I really enjoy the comfort of feeling that I belong somewhere. I will stay on this for a minute. This is definitely a thing. I realize that in america, I feel too comfortable. I can walk around understanding everyone and doing things and feeling that same sense of belonging regardless of my actions. Here, in Paris, I have to take action to belong. If I want to sing I have to dance, sing, live, and breath and be in order to fit in. Who is Chi? I do not know what it means to be me anymore. Everyday I am confronted with things that I do and do not want to do at the same time. The things that I do not want to do I must do because they are good for me, make my life fun, and at the end, I will have appreciated that I did that thing. On the other hand, If I don't do something that I didn't want to do, I forget it and nothing in my life changes. End of thread. I don''t know where I was going with that. The other thing I want to talk before I go is being polarizing. I don't really want to go through the shit that i did in Paris but I will just because I feel the need. I will come back to the topic I need to cover. On the first day, I arrived and did nothing. I walked around my neighborhood, visited sacre-coeur the basilica, and went to the bar with hostel mates. I met some people along the way who's pictures I will post. The australian, Will. I talked with him until 4 in the morning of my first night in Paris. That was the first time I smoked a cigarette. I smoked more tonight. Is this a thing? No. I will try to keep this confined to Paris or just Europe but just Paris if I can make it be. I wanted him to feel like he belonged. I wanted to be his home away from home. I refuse to say no homo. But here it is inserted. On Wednesday, the roles have reversed and now I smoked with several of the guys from the bar. I did it to fit in not the other way around this time."
how to do philochkos business,2020-02-06 05:17:00,"the last question is payment - what is the breakdown of the pay that phil gets versus that that the model gets I think it's 20% and he could operate that way. once you have the youtube channel and the instagrams, you create a lot of content with the girl or she creates content alone. you post it to a youtube channel, patreon and instagram. maybe you create a website for all of this shit. work all of the leads from there. Let's say you keep all of the money from the main patreon but the side patreon, you only get 20%. you get more content by conducting photoshoots from your house and videos from your house. these don't have to be high quality. girls never have to get naked ass is what gets instagram followers. cheats like comment the letters of where you work and i'll follow are cool to get on explore pages or some shit. link to website or youtube channel in bio how to convince girls to do this shit for you - talk to them and show them the money i doubt he will divulge his secrets - i paid 50 to get his secrets and to talk about russia but fuck it, if i do get in then we gold and it'll be interesting. if not, fuck it, i tried.

reversing the downward spiral,2019-05-30 21:30:00,"Goddamn life has become an absolute shitshow ever since I got back from Russia. For difficulties at my job to insecurities rising again in my dating life, I have been struggling to stay afloat in one way or another for the past 5 months. Here we are, in the middle of 2019, with a business that kinda works but isn't profitable, no corporate job and thus no money to fund said business, a fear of women that seemingly came up out of no where (to the point where I'm afraid to go up to a whore in Tijuana and ask her to have sex with me for money which is a guarantee), and no real plans for the future. That is why I'm here. I need to stop the blood from flowing out of my life and into the ground and get this shit pumping again. I need to come up with a plan for the future that will reverse the destruction to my credit score that this business has done. I need a plan for improvement to get back on my path with the women and start loving this shit once again. I have half a mind to call up Jacob Fast and tell my man's I can't make it to his wedding... but that would be too much for me. I have failed two friends in this already and to drop the ball on the third would hurt me too much. I plan on going out alone tonight here in San Diego. I will go to the beach as soon as I get lifting and 'work' done and start speaking and go from there. Tomorrow I will go to LA and try my hand at the big leagues. Maybe I will stay an extra couple of days in order to spend time with my old friend Alex and my new friends Wilson and Charlie. Ironically enough, if I had made a serious attempt at technically mastering the cloud in those 4 weeks I had to prepare, I would be working with them directly right now. Alas, life and my own brain had different plans. 5/30 - San Diego 5/31 - Los Angeles 6/1 - Denver (If I can make the drive) From here I plan on driving across the country to go to my friend Jacob Fast's Wedding. This will be hard and gruelling. I don't want to do this but I know that it is a mini sacrifice I must make to perform the duty of friendship. I love this man and I wouldn't have made it through chemical engineering without him. I also had an amazing time with his wife at the Taylor Swift concert in Boston 2018 and I wouldn't trade those memories for anything. The level of freedom I was rockin' in those moments was amazing and I loved every minute. That said this will cost me an extra $20-60 in gas not to mention the food costs associated with chilling in that area for those extra days. I might chill and stay in Florida with Chad... If I choose to leave, I will go to Boston to see Britney Sanger which I have been promising since the beginning of May. It has been next to impossible to see this girl since I met her in my Boston trip earlier this year but she had good energy and seems very wholesome. I would love to meet up with her again and see where things go. New thought... I might drive directly to boston and fly from there to Florida, have Chad drive me around for a day, then fly back to start working and messing around. I might stay in Boston for a bit at this point. I have a lot of friends here and I could get a lot of content out with the rompers and probably generate a lot of sales in the RSD community and in the surrounding area. From here (if I leave Boston again) I will go to Baltimore to be with Evan and Jack. This will be fun and debaucherous and I have no doubt that the content will be mighty. I'm excited for this time because this may be semi defining. I will either stay here or go further on to Myrtle Beach. Myrtle Beach was my first love and it would be fitting that this would be the last place that I spend significant amounts of time before I leave this country that I love. This country that is home to my deepest insecurities, failures, successes, loves, hates, and everything in between. Myrtle Beach was my first vacation. Myrtle was one of the first times where I rustled together enough balls to approach girls though my friends didn't help (though nick ended up helping a shit ton). Then in august, I am supposed to go to fucking china (if this next interview goes well that is)! This will be the biggest life change I've had to this point... probably the most drastic other than deciding to take a whole year off to do internships.... which wasn't even a risk at the time. This is a change of careers, a change in cultures, a change in language, and a change in location. Let's get it."
untitled,2019-08-08 03:06:00,"Sometimes I feel like my body is doing things in order to create a narrative. Like it is making my. Life harder by resisting the things. Want to do and doing the things that I don’t want it dot do. I don’t want to remove agency from my person, bu t I just don’t feel like I M in control most of the time. For example today I had an interview with the website teachinnomad. This lady that I was speaking to had a lot of pep and personality. It was oozing through the screen I had none my charisma was at zero from not habit interacted with anyone in that zone and my energy was low. It came to a ;art of the conversation when she asked my what makes me bette than the other teachers. I was going to answer the question with something about being outgoing but the n I realized that nothing in this interview had shown an soda of out going ness . Girls learned the word gas lighting and started using it like candy The sincerity with which caelynn is I think onyeka is a goddamn house nigger who believes every damn word that Massa tells her. She wants to be Caelynn so bad and it’s stupid and boring the extent to which she is towing the line for her. She doesn’t know the situation, she doesn’t know the man, yet she’s jumping to all these conclusions. Fuck Caelynn for being a goddamn snake about the situation. This is proof the women can’t sleep with men and not develop feelings."
40 - today i shaved my beard,2018-09-18 13:25:00,"I had sex with Marissa Lowell 2 who was literally the second Marissa that I met in Lowell that day in August who's number I got. I will be having intercourse with the other one in a couple weeks. She had a good butt but an extremely small vagina. So small that there was nothing that I could really do to get anything other than the head in. Which was extremely off putting. i hated that. Compound that with a distinct lack of personality, will, confidence, hobbies, or interests and I'm not here for it. This is the type of shit that I hat about most of the women I've been meeting. The bullshit part is that she kinda passes my filter tests for being a person who was interesting and did shit. But when pressed she couldn't come up with any random interesting fictions on that random shit that I could point out, she had no will to create plans and do something that she was interested in with me, and she was sexually inexperienced to a point of no return. I could probably deal with a couple of those but not all of them. And for that, Marissa, you're fired. I only want to be friends which I do genuinely mean. I will invite you to shit and introduce you to people and have interesting fun times near you and you can stay near me, but the whole thing where we kiss and hold each other and do all that extra bullshit, I'm not here for it. I've really been trying to figure out what I want in the females and I really would get in a relationship if a girl was actually interesting and had actual opinions and had actual boundaries. Anyway, I shaved my beard today. and I care way more about my beard than these hoes and today I shaved it. So today I thought about breaking up with you. Joe Davis came through with the good work yesterday, providing me with the opportunity to make a difference based on the metrics and usage of the superior organization of GE. that should make my work life a bit easier or at least let off of the gas a bit so that i can understand the wold a bit better (doubt that makes sense but I refuse to rewrite it so)"

Of course, I just did adderall. I'm going to take another and ride out to complete my list of things for tomorrow. I just fundamentally don't feel serious. Those feelings that I had before about trusting myself are creeping back in. If you have this scheduling app and an apple watch and you don't operate according to any of the alarms or the schedule, that is bad. Not because you are following the schedule but because you set an expectation and are falling short of that expectation. It's better to just work and not have that expectation than to fall short.Been differentiating between low dopamine and actual sadness and depression or just non stimulation. I've been more addicted to my phone lately. doomscrolling as they call it on my chosen app of youtube. occasional porn and masterbating.Nothing is necessarily bad - i just see something else. maybe i'm destined to this life of larping. this life of imaginatoin and potential with no outlet.a goala real goal. i think a real goal is to get through this whole make.com automation course by the end of the year. like fuck you and die but get htat whole fucking thing done. that's all. just fucking do the whole fucking thing man. I want to do it because I want the knowledge to apply in every area of life. I want to be a damn expert at this shit. but whyi guess i want it because i want to accomplish something else. i just want to feel like i did something else. of course i need to understand that the source of my discontent is in the desire and the moving from a place of scarcity and lack rather than a place of abundance and confidence."
the stories of 65-71 Moscow Russia,2019-12-24 00:56:00,"I don't want to forget these so here we go. met sayora at gypsy. that night I arrived with my boy andrey. i was killin shit from the beginning. found a different girl, taller cute. she was cool. pulled her outside to smoke where i first met sayora. i liked her immediately because i could tell she was eccentric. flirted a bit before she went inside with her friend. I flirted with the other girl but ended up leaving her when we couldn't get a drink at the bar (it was too busy) but she wouldn't give up on the drink. explored the dance floor and danced with sayora. she was the best dancer. I loved every second. she fell in love when I danced with her and timed picking her up to the beat of whatever song was playing. didn't kiss her that night. ended up being kind've of a battle between her and the tall girl to get me. she was way hotter and much better of a dancer. it was a shame because that tall girl's friends were all pushing her to get with me. I couldnt close because the risk of sayora seeing was too high. i closed sayora with a number and texted her the next day. we met for soup and she came back to my place after for 'wine'. she was trembling as i took her clothes off. I was dominant and made her feel comfortable and persisted past her objections. she squirted 3 times. we had sex probably 6-7 times. way too many. she said her pussy was hurting after. i came maybe 3 times. she took a morning after pill after she left. I haven't seen her since though we've been stringing each other along. it's over now on my end. maria - i randomly met one of my classmates (learning russian) on the streets of moscow while trying to find the speakeasy that I found in russia on my first trip. he is a virgin. he came to propaganda with me and left soon after entering. i met this cool ass mided dude who was my friend all night. we danced all night. he met a girl. then i met two girls outside who i insta closed with the promise of a threesome on sunday. kissed them both. went inside and met a girl who was with a guy. it went well. the guy didnt' interject at all so i ignored him. found out soon that he was a random she had just met. pulled her to the bar. kissed her. bought drinks. kissed more. lost her for a bit when one girl i had been hitting on earlier came back to dance with me. found her again and danced for a bit before leaving. we walked most of the way back to my place. got a taxi to my place. took a bit of BS but i convinced her to come in for one drink. she put up a hell of a fight, talking all this shit about being tired. we drank a shit ton of wine. it went well. ended up losing her soon after when i invited her to an event that one of my other girls showed up at too (lika from couchsurfing). it went bad and i took lika out of the venue, took her to the jazz club that maria suggested. this situation goes down in the list of evil shit i've done. holy shit - i realize i really need ot write these up in the moment because doing it right now is a lot of work kate N - met her at mayak. ridiculous story. met so so many girls this night. started with a date with Nova a gril i har randomly met in the street the week before. she was a casting director with kids. not interested in me prob because if wasn't a rich dude. she invited her brother who showed up and then they both left. i went back in and met two girls. they were fun and i danced with them a bit. then i struggled for awhile. then i met some oil executives who bought me a beer. i chilled for awhile. then this girl leyla stared me down and her friends pushed her toward me. i danced with her. (i've been on two dates with her since and she barely lets me kiss her). i pulled leyla outside for a smoke and went in before her. while she was outside i danced with 1-2 crazy sexy girls. one of them was kate N. then i saw leyla waiting patiently close by. i danced with her until she left. the whole itime kate was staring me down. i never really gave kate much. she was my fallback all night. i tried with this two set that i IG closed... turns out the one has a kid. went super hard near a girl i had been eyeing all night. she finally stood up and came to dance with me. so sexy. then she left abruptly. so i finally danced with kate. pulled kate outside to smoke. the hot girl came up ot me and said something in an upset voice in russian and kinda hit me. i asked kate for the translation and she said somone had stolen the girls phone while she was dancing with me. I didn't attempt to comfort the hot girl since i know the implicatoin was that I had somehting ot do with the theft. i talked ot a guy that had a guitar and strummed on it a bit before pulling kate back inside. i made out with ehr for a bit on the chair right befoer the entrance. she said she couldn't go home with me because she had to take a trip out to the countryside ot visit fam early the next day. cool. danced with her till she left. then doug showed up and we danced around and then left to go to inostransi (foreigner in russian) it was decent there. i found one girl named nadia who i danced with a bit before she was taken back (literally picked up and moved) by a boyfriend and his friend. they were both bigger than me so i didn't really do anything. i had a second chance to talk to her but i didn't really go hard enough so i lost it. i talked to this girl and guy in the corner. a black guy came and offerend me drugs. i pulled the girl and the guy outside. ended up going with them to a random club in the southeast of the city. the back of this bar had a room with sand. did some sort of weed or drugs there. i was high as fuck. rode the high out on the dance floor till i felt comfortable enought to leave. then i left. met kate a few days later. took her to soup cafe only had one wine there before pulling her to my place for wine. didn't kiss her yet. put on 50 shades freed and waited till the 1st or 2nd sex sceneto pull a move. had a discussion about how she thinks black people are too sensitive in russia about the word negr. cool girl. luba from bumble - this is a much shorter story. met her at a coffee place. talked for awhile before she came back ot my place. i was technically not allowed ot bring her to my place since i'm not allowed to have guests at my flat because of liden and denz rules. i tlaked to the security guards befoer though so they didnt' snitch (yet... still hasn't been a full week since). banged pretty immediately. kept going soft throughout. she was cool and showed me stormzy's new album. the 3some - damn. this is hard to go through.. just 2 more though. went to this bar Barka. not even on google maps. cool spot. rolled in their and started by talking to two dudes. BSed with them. opened a 2 set and tried to merge. the dudes weren't down and dipped. i talked to the girls. turned out ot be married. let them go when two of my friends from the weekend prior showed up. tried to get them to do some approaching but they weren't down. talked to a girl who had lived in germany befoer (sophia). whatsapp closed. moved on and talked to two groups. then i went and talked to an older woman and flirted really hard. dropped her and went back to my friends. started talking to this really cute young girl on the way back. tried to IG close and it was a no go. met the guy who served me drings earlier. he was the manager of the bar and we talked for a long time. then a really drunk guy approached me and was trying to talk to me. one of the girls from on e of the 2 groups earlier, reapproached. we kinda talked as a group of 3, me her and the drunk dude. i tried to get a read on this girl. she was very skittish and didn't want me to touch her at all but was cool talking. i asked her for advice on talking to russian girls. she said something about finding some cute ones. then i asked her to come back into the main part of the bar so i could see her taste in girls. she pointed out this really cute 3 set of 2 girls and one dude. i said lets go talk to them. she said okay and i opened. i stayed in set for awhile, dancing and talking with the group. that skittish girl left and went back to her freind. i find out that the guy is dating one of the girls and that the other girl has a boyfriend. whatever. i insta close the group and they leave. i open this 2 set that has kinda been eyeing me all night. ithink i convinced them to come to a club with me and they said they wanted to smoke first. they smoked with me (i didn't smoke) and then i set lets go and they said that they'd finish their drinks and come outside. they took too long so i went back in and started talking to them again. they talked to me for awhile. then they came outside with me again. i said lets go and they said they needed to do one more thing inside... grab their purses or something. i said they have 5 minutes and i'm leaving. they came out exactly at 5 minutes. i held both of their hands and walked down the street. the one girl had a sparkle in her eye and i could tell there might be some fun stuff about the happen. i let them walk ahead and whisper a bit a couple times. we went to propaganda and danced a bit. they went out and smoked while i chilled inside. the one girl (less attractive but the leader of the group) came up behind me and asked me if i wanted to get out of there with them. i said yes. we left and went ot tis bar that was closed... deadass climbed thorugh the windo to get in. chilled there for 15 or so minutes. everything was in russian and i wasn't acknoledged too much. finally i did a little talking and touching of the less attractive one and she said we should go back t oher place and bring the little cutie with us. we went back to her place which was around the corner and did the stuff. i started making out with the less attractive one first. then the other girl joined in. the first girl left the room for a min and the cuter girl wanted to chill till the other girl came back. the 1st girl was definietley way more into me. still both girls tried hard and did all the stuff. sucked my dick with a condom on which is bs but fine. fucked them both to a decent level. not great. kept going soft here too. pissed me off since this is a dream of mine. took me a fucking lot but eventually i was able to cum. we fucked as a group twice. in between we went to the kitchen and talked politics for a while. the one girl was from ukraine and the other girl (less att.) was from russia and had participated in the protests that happened in 2019/18 where people were arrested. cool convo. slept for a lil. fucked the less attractive one in the morening. came inside of her accidentially... kinda on accident... i wanted to cum so i kept moving the condom up so that more of my dick would feel the pussy.i guess it came all the way off. she didnt' notice. hopefully she doesn't have a child. she took a shower. she was way late for work since she had hit the snooze button for an hour or so. we left together and got on the tram. she brougtht a guistar missing the E string. i played taylor swift on the tram. we parted ways. fuck damn. now the last one. fuck it that's the last one for tonight. 70 71 was daniella petrova"
The Nine Immutable Laws of Game – Roosh V,2017-02-28 05:40:00,"1) If you find yourself asking for advice on how to get a particular girl, you won’t get her. a. The person with the lower value is going to be seeking advice and knowledge. The one with higher value doesn’t care because they know that their value is higher subconsciously. b. You are saying that her value is higher than yours and that you are scared of screwing it up. c. Solution: Don’t ask for advice on any girl. It will prevent you from leaking bad needy game out into the world. It is also a confirmation of her value being higher than yours. 2) If a girl hasn’t had sex in a month, she will be easier to have sex with than one that has had sex within a week. Reverses over time. a. When was the last time you had sex? b. Sweet spot – 2 weeks to 2 months 3) You are not going to be good unless you start thinking of pickup as a job. a. Good equates to higher notch counts of random girls. b. Doesn’t apply to traditional girls. c. True if you want to fuck a lot of westernized girls. 4) The opener is the least impactful part of the pickup. a. Best opening is asking for help for anything. b. Rule of thumb – don’t stop until she walks away. 5) The men you surround yourself with do more to predict your future success than your knowledge of the game. 6) You will get flaked on till you die. a. The emotional bond is out there and when you find that, she will not flake. b. The root cause of flaking is her having options. 7) Pickup difficulty is relative based on size, type, and quality of a venue. a. Lots of logistical realities to take into account. 8) You will go home empty-handed if you pass over the sure thing. 9) The more you work, the more you get. 10) New law – what you like today will change. – Don’t heavily invest in something that you think you might be disinterested in a few months. I agree with all of these. Bye"
am i not enough? + to go full RSD or nah,2018-11-12 17:27:00,"There is a new issue on foot. and that is leaving sets too early. There with be an interaction that is going well and instead of pushing deeper or leading to the dance floor or transitioning to another conversation topic, I'll close with a gram or a number and dip. I know I closed to early because 10m later that same girl is with another dude (usually another nigga) and I am sitting with my hands in my pockets. There is a fear there. Especially when we are talking about the more beautiful girls. Something inside doesn't think that it is possible or that I could actually hold onto a girl who has more going for her than her looks or a girl that is hotter than a 7. It happened at Liberty Friday when I was gaming with mike (I love that dude) and it happened saturday when I was gaming with keith on the last set. If it was someone else, I would say, ""My nigga, stick it out till they leave or then end."" To be fair, they had just hit us with some 'we need to go to the bathroom type of bullshit to get out and I scerted that by going for a close... I need to get back into fighting for what I want. The good part is that all my bullshit insecurities about specific interactions, etc, is inside and doesn't really manifest in the visual version of the reality of the situation. What I mean is that all the dudes around me view me as god or as something different when I am really messing up left and right. do I want to teach though? Like really teach underprivileged men how to talk to women. And do everything else that goes along with that. I think I'm ready. I mean at the end of the day, you don't have to be a master to bring everyone else up to level 1. I don't have the mental energy to really finish this article... I am busy thinking of what to do next... work is weird because there is limited shit that I can do on the production floor when the boss of this shit want's to take everything in a different direction. I can write up the rest of this work instruction (that is what I will do today), 3D print the part I need as an adapter for my rotameter test stand, design the gas feed side of the water wall that I will try to be coordinating in the next few weeks, and that's all. So that is a significant amount of work but I am stuck on the gas feed design because I don't know where the part files are or how they fit together and I am stuck on the rotameter design because I don't know what parts exist and what parts don't. Like can I go steal shit from the W&T supermarket or do I have to go through a process and what is actually going to work here.. What in the old stand do I need to recreate to get the same or better performance? All good questions. I will set up a meeting with Ryan. I want this to be better so I am returning to it a day later. I am procrastinating the work instruction project as we speak (I didn't get it done yesterday because I didn't do anything yesterday), so be fore warned at the amazing quality writing that I will produce to get out of something that I know I have to do. I realize that the quality of dude that is out there teaching pickup is low. These dudes literally figured out how to say hi to a girl and just rinse and repeat. All these pickup channels are dime a dozen and there really is no difference from one guy to the next as far as these low tier dudes go. Generally, you see them fail with the girls that I would want to succeed at and succeed at the yes girls... which is where I'm at and I'm not interested in content that would match my bullshit. I understand that that content isn't for me but Owen and all his friends were teaching this shit almost from day one and living their teachings. That is a whole different way to be. I don't think that I will be winging students generally. If anything, I will come in and just take over the set seemingly easily and force them to stay and take notes on what I was doing that they did not do. Daygame is asshole. Following up with the musicians that I have met in my time in boston. There have been two mainly and I want to get their feedback on my bullshit before continuing on my journey. Chris Waller was the first one. Old black dude that was absolutely killing at the wedding that we met at. He was in the wedding band. Genuinely, infinite energy. Admireable and if I can get even 4% of his pizazz, I'll be on fire. Haha I don't know that value that I've actually added to this post by reopening it but whatever."

lisa isn't working out,2020-11-10 22:23:00,"I was a bitch - I bitched out. I became a woman. talking about my insecurities and talking about the relationship instead of just living. I became a pussy and the girl left.GoddamnIt's such a fucking waste. I hate girls. I hate liking them, I hate the process of courtship, I hate everything about this shit. I hate it. Today I called and talked to Lisa - the girl I'm fake in love with. I'm a damn idiot. What is wrong with me. I remember how and why I was so fucking careful not to put Sayora on a pedestal - because if I had acted one iota of the person that I am right now, she would have dipped. And so would any other girl. And for some reason, the only thing that gives me the confidence and the business to not give a fuck about girls enough to treat them normally is having other girls around. It's the only thing up to this point.I was talking to lisa on the phone, hour 2 and then abruptly, just like yesterday, the call ended. yesterday, at least, there was a reason - specifically that she suspected that I was trying to manipulate her into liking me more because of the way I was explaining my thoughts to her. I explained that two things had happened that day, the first being that I say a video of my ex that made me think about her and the second that I saw a video on youtube that made me wish that I was a hoe again - and she had an interesting idea that i was using it to make her feel jealous. and she was kinda justified in thinking that though it wasn't true. I just didn't have my filter uptoday I was insecure because she said she didn't want to stay at my place for 5 days because she wanted to date normally. i started being a little boy and complaining about how i dont like dating and how it made me uncomfortable and scared that I would be a bitch and made me want to have other girls and then she correctly called me out that I was being a manipulative by telling her this as it kinda seemed like a threat - if she didn't come to my place or didn't give me the relatioinship that I want taht I will leave or something. but I moved on from that conversation by saying that watever will happen will happen.she then started talking about greek mythology and that I should come to her performace at the end of the month. she was telling me about the greek myth that she was in charge of directing or acting in. I had my eyes closed and it's possible that I missed a question that she had ... I'm not sure - but what ever happened, she hung up, didn't read my messages and declined my call twice... it makes me a little bit worried about her..and i'm being a faggot and calling her and messaging her. i will set a record for being a bitch tonight. i'm not proud of it. okay so called for the 5 or 6th time and she just didn't even decline it that time, just let it ring though. I have seen those guys. I am that guy. okay. cool. cool.okayso i need to be a leader again. i forget my role often and confuse freedom or being without filter as the real me rather than as some weak cunt that must be rangled and controlled at all cost."
i'm back,2023-03-05 00:41:00,"the hoe is backlord. we are outside. in the absolute wildest way. I don't know if it's the worst way yet but tbd. I don't really want to be like this. I like the world where women want to be respected and taken out n allat. And many do. But. a lot and dare I say many many if not most are absolutely wylin especially in America.Like lordy, the wildshit that tonight bout to entail. I'm not worried but I'm apprehensive that this will take away from my boals. and it very obviously will. but life is about living. I want to be big n shit but I also want to enjoy. so here we gopart of this process is being cool with making mistakes--like going for the same thing too quick... trash. i shouldn't invited her to meet me out first since I already show my shot to get her to come over to the spot.. or I should have changed it more in a meaningful way. but alas it is what it is. I am speaking about my texts with Kassie.I texted Dominique earlier with some absolutely yfrakly wild shit and it bounced.. that said, not everything is boing to go through but you miss all the shots you don't take. and if some thing isn't working out, you should push and see if a different method will produce results."
Leah Casto... girlfriend???,2017-02-13 19:27:00,"Jesus mate. We are right on the edge about to have a girlfriend. Except I don't know how to do it. And also I don't want to do it. It is so easy to just drop this and live. It would be so easy to just forget about her and do my thing. Is it possible to differentiate between that which I should do because it will be good for me and I will regret not taking advantage of later and not doing that which I do not want to do? Yes. There is and it is located in the balls. I know what it is that I should do but at the same time, there is some anxiety that I am fucking this up just like I fucked up every other relationship with every girl that I have interacted with in the past. I'm scared. I'm anxious. This is not good for me. Especially when I have the weight of chemical engineering coming right down on my neck. I will try to hang out with her today during my study break but if she refuses, it's getting dropped till Friday. It isn't that difficult to do everything. It really isn't Chi. Calm down. Send the text. Turn off Bluetooth and put the phone on do not disturb mode. Simple. Badda bing badda boom. Do you my brotha, do you."
update - also 35,2018-04-09 01:11:00,"I had sex with the german girl that I met over spring break after driving over 9 hours to spend a weekend with her in rhode island. Then I drove up to fall river to have sex with Kirsten rider again. That's that. In life though, I have been thinking a lot about the way I want to take things. While I want to make a valid contribution to the earth and impact it in high level ways that other people may not be able to, I am fighting the other part of me that wants to travel, become a pro musician, make youtube videos, and live like I'm going to die tomorrow. Those two things are mutually exclusive. I am struggling more and more to maintain focus on the things that matter. It is also the case that every day I get closer and closer to being done forever and I am so very eager to move on with my life. I don't know what to say or talk about in this format. I have been making videos more often as of late but I now for a fact that I will not look back on these videos nearly as often as I will look bak on thes blog posts. I really am trying to write something where thought. I am decising between russia nad going on a buddhist retreat for 10 days. I know that the 10 day buddhist retreat will change my perspective on life and give me a whole new way of lookin at things. I could also spend that extra ten days in russia possibly traveling with semi famous people having the time of my life trying to learn the language. Two very different journeys and I don't know which is the right one. I really think that I should take the time to explore meditation deeper because I really feel that there are truths hidden there that could make me a generally happy person. I also feel that I live most of my life in a semi buddhist way even though I am blinded to the actual truth of it and why those things that I do actually 'work'. I want to learn a language and a culture I want to hang out with my friends in america (dustin) I want to learn about the universe or at least myself through buddhist meditation"
Britney pt. 3,2015-08-07 14:12:00,"I feel absolutely awful. I found out a little bit more about my self today. I am just holding on and filling a certain void with chasing girls and game. Of course, I knew I was doing this all along. This is one of my goals in life and since there is no ultimate purpose, I live towards being good with women and eventually finding a good k-selected female to have babies and grow old with. I have been filling my brain and time with going out with the hope of either sex or coming in contact with an at least partially k-selected female. I always have the best conversations and the best times with those kinds of girls. I’ve been telling myself for a while now that going out with expectations of positive outcomes is not the right attitude to have. My life is currently this big wave and I think a lot of it has to do with my insecurity at certain levels of facial hair. I know how to talk to girls and game for the most part but there is something about having long or shaped facial hair that takes my confidence away. I feel like Samson in the bible for this specific Epiphany: also since I started my club game, I’ve been just dancing on girls instead of talking to them. This may have made me more quietist and less confident with my words and more confident with my dancing . My biggest issue in my whole life is being consistent. At the end of every activity that takes months whether it be school or a job or a relationship, I tend to slack off and the quality of my work diminishes. I’ve been able to struggle through this many times but I need to make this an exception the rule that is me. I need to make this inconsistent Chi a thing of the past. I’m making sure to specify that I don’t mean consistency with pulling girls or with results. I mean consistency with the way I am trying to attempt to complete any given task."
thinking I'm better,2015-08-28 06:30:00,"Tonight, I was trying this new thing called having standards for who I talk to and hit on. This way, I thought I could artificially increase he value that I am presenting. It did not. It instead lead to a quiet night of people watching. No doubt, I saw many interesting visuals . The issue is, I paid money to get into a place and did not do any work. None at all almost negligible. I wouldn't even say I tried, because the truth is I didn't. I thought I was so good that if I was to get rejected by one of the peasants that it would be the end of my ego and my world. That's why your supposed to check your ego a the door and leave everything out on the night. Also, how the actual fuck does Ryan fuck all these girls. He literally does nothing. He actually never does anything. I have never seen him try to get a girl. I don't know how he does it. it's very upsetting. its so easy. I come home and there is a naked girl (has t shirt on but when she shifts you could see many things) in my kitchen. asking for water. absurd. absolutely absurd. I just get so frustrated and annoyed when I see these Morgantown girls. The same thing happened in fed hill but at least those girls were semi professional or professional. These hoes are worthless pieces of nothing. They are actually good for sex and nothing else. In a few hears, they might be worth more than their crop top and booty shorts but, for now, they aren't. But even these lowlife fuck girls don't have sex with me. I would fuck any of them. And I know for a fact that many different women think that I'm attractive. It peeves the shit out of me seeing these pretty sluts traipsing around town with little on then deny me, saying that I'm a good guy and that my time will come. I kinda turned down a fuck yesterday.... inadvertently. I guess I was just too keeper material for a one night stand. But then the bitch doesn't text me back the next day. So honestly, fuck all this shit. I have no clue how my life is going to work out. I haven't had a relationship with any girl lasting more than 3 dates. Absurd. I'm 21. It feels like I'm a virgin again. I'm a relationship and love virgin. I wouldn't know what do do if I found it. Still, there is a nice lady out in Baltimore who likes me for some reason. I have no clue why. I want to find out. p.s. beard is coming in pretty soon."
being unreasonable (me),2016-09-13 13:18:00,"I don’t like women. I don’t like these women specifically. I hate her face. I hate her voice. I don’t like her fake disingenuous attitude. Same with the interns. They are the same. I don’t kuje tge way they are talking to each other. The guy is a priviledged piece of shit who will probably make it to be an engineer for someone at some point but I anticipate he will be married in 4 years, get divorced in 10 and hace 2 kids lost to some evil woman. And that is going to suck but it is part of life but honestly I don’tcare and I don’t feel bad. IThese are the choises that he is making now in his life that wll end up affecting him forever. And I hope something bad happens to these two women. I don’t really have to hope it tbh… it’s inevitable. The one is fat and is going to be monstrous size in a few years. She’s going to be a sngle mom and doesn’t give a shit about anyone elses wellbeing except her own. I say that because she once told me that she would forgo breastfeeding for the simple fact that it would give her saggy boobs. When I mentioned that her potential child would be smarter and have a higher IQ if she did , she said, “I don’t care.” That is another level of irrationality that I cannot condone. Well not that my condonance has any affect on others lives at this point. And maybe it shouldn’t. I’m just having a spurt of emotion that I have to get out. Sio bye I’m still becoming a person.

Oblivious: I'm scared of women,2016-10-09 22:12:00,"It's true. Not all the time but this is real. I do want to distinguish two separate reasons for this fear. First, there is the absolute power of slander that can destroy a man and his reputation for life. That's not what this is about. This is about fear of being hurt. Emotionally. In a relationship. Shocker right. It seems like that's the only purpose of this blog is to express my hurt about the females in my life. Whatever Natalie difjdjcjdllsmab (some Italian last name). Am I cursed to be alone forever? Tangent 1: Absurd how these other pussy dudes are still in contact with these females. Idk how these guys snapchat and text these girls every day with a nebulous chance, date, or time when they are going to see that girl again. This sentence could be written better too.Girls like me. They like my face and my confidence. They want to have sex with me for the first few minutes of meeting me. I can even maintain that feeling in the girl for a few hours or days depending on the amount of interaction therein. Somewhere along the line though, the situation deteriorates. The amount of tunes I have had sex is due to me taking advantage of this period of time I'm going to call the sex stupor (until I come up with a better name). Pause, I'm going to to try to talk to a girl here at UGA. ONE SECBack. I couldn't do it. My life is just a cycle of lacks and boosts of confidence. Jesus. I'm hurting. My chest hurts. Where my heart is located. God help me.Anyway, whenever I have one of these confidence shifts and can speak to the other gender, we get the sex stupor. Now if I somehow convince a female to be alone with me then it's literally and I have sex. The stupor is always temporary. Then the girl decides that my behavior is not what she is looking for and we 'break up'. I put that in quotes because up til this moment in my life I have not had a girlfriend. Which is sad and scary. Natalie is the latest manifestation of this phenomenon. She liked me. She had a huge crush on me, touching my arms, and more stuff ( I can tell when a girl is into me) ((seriously I can so fuck you if you want to talk shit at this point)) (((when you're in the game for as long as I have been you develop an intuition about these things))) Anyway. Then she kept saying I was weird. She kept expressing about how I'm the weirdest person she's ever met, how I'm the most touchy person she's ever met. Shit I've heard before. I know I need to stop touching girls. But I can't. Well I can. But anyway shit like that. Anyway she ended up rejecting me last night and now I'm afraid of women.I'm afraid of doing all the work to make a girl like me and then losing it. I really want to date a girl. I need to. That experience or lack thereof really holds me back. I think about this stuff a lot. I'm trying to become a person. Help me. The fear or losing girls that I haven't spoken to yet is irrational. I know. It's still 'm just wallowing a little. I know. I'll talk to a girl today. I have to. I really have to. Oblivious is what people are. We are oblivious to all the swirlings, conflicts, loves, hates, fears, and recent actions of the people around them. I just tried to create pseudo serendipity with a girl so I could speak to her without having to run up behind her to tap her on the shoulder. Me with my heart rate at 120 is standing there facing a pretty face and I chickened out. She had no clue that I just ran up 3 flights of stairs and around 4 buildings to get in front and talk to her. Wtf I know. I know that's unacceptable. But fuck you and the rest of the societal standards for what's acceptable (at least in this area). Anyway, I thought that was interesting. Let me go try and talk to another female. #becomingaperson #breakingthecycle"
48 - ole social worker (43),2018-12-17 19:18:00,"I pulled another married woman from Moldova on thursday but couldn't close because she got cold feet as we got closer to her place. I didn't know she actually lived with the guy. It's a wierd situation because you don't want to call attention to the fact that she is being a piece of shit by bringing up the guy but you still need to find out logistics to plan for BS. The past is that past, always screen for logistics. Saturday I pulled an old woman from liberty. I did this with matt pupa as a wing. I wanted ot fuck both and I might have tried but alas. the other one was more attractive IMO but I went for the sure thing. I didn't think matt was going to be able to handle the other one alone and that would be the girl that would send us all packing. I closed after a few rejections. She was an interesting woman. She'd lived in romania for many years, travelled all over eastern europe, russia, and even africa doing social work. I di like old women because they have actually done shit most of the time and there is more to engage on whereas young girls are ditzy and don't even have passports. The old bishes will also more readily listen to a diatribe about the book I just read where the young girl would pipe up with somehting mid story and you'd have to let hte conversation thread derail into jokes. I will hit 50 before the end of the year. I have a date with an old middle school teacher (fuck yeah). She's 40+, maybe 50 and she teaches yoga. She isn't especially fit or attractive but hte novelty of fucking one of those women when I was young appeals to me. I want to satisy 14 year old chi who didn't know his dick from his hand. bye"
"Dear Zoey Vilasuso, (iPhone)",2011-11-11 08:00:00,"Dear Zoey Vilasuso, Honestly you were and are my dream girl. I loved saying hi to you everyday and occasionally having a conversation. Seriously, the day you said yes to go out on a date with me was probably one of the best days of my life and I will always remember it. The Saturday of that date I remember texting you that morning twice. When I didn't get a response after like 6 hours I literally cried. And I guess we drifted apart since. I hate that we don't talk anymore. Why is that? You're one of the cutest girls I've met and I wish we had gone on that date. I know I'm might not the hottest guy you've even talked to or the funniest. But give me a chance! I think my conversation skills with pretty girls has gotten better since we last talked. I just want to know what caused you to stop liking me? Was I too persistent? Was I just not good enough? Ps. I love your eyes.. For my looking into them is among my favorite experiences cheez"
should i break up with mary or be exclusive with her,2020-06-30 04:33:00,"Crazy that you're even thinking about this. The options: Keep things as they are - open relationship - need to find things to do together - need to find a way to break out of my boring logical stink that doesn't involve talking to random girls or people - need to find a way to have fun with her again - try travelling again and see if there's still a vibe for when you do that together - she should be the most important thing for me and other girls are forever secondary --> this is doable though I'm scared that one day a girl will come along that will be so pretty and cool that she'll knock mary off of the throne. Am I allowed to continue in this choice with that as a possibility? I guess technically it's not a possibility if I don't allow it but what if I want it? This is all imaginary but damn, it'a very real scenario considering that I meet someone absolutely amazing every six months or so. Break up with her - the feeling that you have of disinterest or boringness is because you are incompatible - you literally can't do anything with her at this point - meet new people, dance, go to parties - fuck you can't even comfort her when she's hurting or crying (evidenced by today when she broke down with her friends and wanted nothing to do with me for an hour or so and even after that hour, when she asked me to sleep with her and I did for 20-30 minutes, she went back to sleeping with her friend who she had been touchy with and laying with all night) - maybe she wants to continue her life as is - I'm not sure how she would respond to me saying that I'm not comfortable with her sleeping with her friends or cuddling with them in that way... maybe she would say, ""Okay, I won't do that"" but only maybe if we were in an exclusive relationship - maybe definitely she wants an exclusive relationship with me - she has rescinded sex on her side of the open relationship (so she won't have sex with the new guys she meets) and desperately wants things to be the same on my side but she'll never say what she wants or admit that. She says that she is okay with doing whatever I want. She is hanging on by a thread and keeps getting herself ready for me to walk out on her. --> If that's not something that I'm willing to give to her (sacrifice hoeing), then I must leave if I believe that she wants something that I can't give her - I think she needs a guy that will be all in on her - a guy who knows his way around women who is responsible and also fun who can make her feel special each and every day but also be so awesome and legit that she can't think of another person who she should be with - OR she needs to play the field and learn how to tell people what she wants and be assertive --> with me she is just waiting on me to lead us to something... which I guess is maybe normal for a male and female relationship - I just don't know where I can lead us anymore Become exclusive with her - maybe it's possible that you can grow together but that you both just need time to explore with each other and find the things that we actually love about each other. I don't like that she can't tell me what she loves about me - maybe this could fix her closed-off-ness and allow her to open up her heart and her feelings about me. I know someone needs to do this someday with her so why not me - again you would still need to figure out what you could do with her and what to keep separate and what to do together. How far are each of us allowed to take flirting? Can we each still meet people from dating apps? This is strikingly similar and weird to my dad and mom's relationship... He stayed with her and fought through because he pitied her or something like that, according to him. Am I staying with her out of some sense of duty because I led her down this path of feelings by inviting her on this trip in the first place? Am I staying with her because I really like her or love her or just because I can see material worth in our partnership from a business and logical standpoint? Am I staying with her because I want to or because it's easier than letting her go? 2 updates I found out after calling her time morning that her friend, the louder guy who's apartment we were in at kotelniki, was telling her that I don't care about her and that she should break up with me. He was telling her this when she was crying - maybe this was the original reason for her crying, I don't know. She said that she told him,""yes I know I know [I should break up with him] but I don't want to speak about it."" And she then changed the subject. So really she thinks that I don't care about her or she thinks that I don't care about her the same way that she cares about me and that we shouldn't be together but can't bring herself to let go of our relationship because of the feelings that she won't admit to on her side. We talked a bit extra and I talked some positivity into her life - she lost her university scholarship because she didn't call the guy that she needed to call to complete the testing so now she feels like she's stupid - at the same time she was given a promotion at her fitness club to manager and she's making sales, being a trainer, and learning how to run the business. I'm trying to keep the train on the rails by reminding her of the logic of why she didn't want to complete this degree in the first place and that with this opportunity, she has a direct path to understand how to run a fitness Club business and a route to actually being mentored into this by professionals who have been doing this for years. Now can I promote her and be in her corner as her friend, without feelings? yes. Is it possible for people to break off the physical part of the relationship while keeping the closeness? maybe. I think I can appreciate her growth from here without involving myself with the pain that my activities causes. I will continue to think. Maybe there's something we can do together - a dance class and travelling on Sundays for example, that can pave the road to a companionship that will last a longer time. Should I do it is the real question?"
i'm still tired of life but i'm somehow still going,2021-04-06 19:06:00,"found out that I lost my whole ass wallet today. I took off my pants while dancing yesterday up at the law school. left them around and could have sworn I put them in teh vehicle before I left. someone may have taken them but it makes no sense as they would have taken the backpack too. I don't even know when someone could have. in any case, the pants - the oldest jeans i own, the comb in the pockets, and the wallet in the back pocket are gone.and this is normal. and i hate myself. I have such a depth of self loathing. ironically my heart rate has stayed very low. I don't become excited by such news. I never have. I just understand that it's a fucked situation which is somehow normal for me and move on. This life. this sameness. it's boring. and the recurring archetypes - losing extremely important things and having to struggle ot replace them and in that process something comes up that requires the use of some or many of the items that were lost. I'm aware of the pattern and now I'm sitting waiting for some absolute horseshit to happen at which point I will laugh at the heavens and at my despair. I will laugh and laugh and hate my self more and hate life and all that it is and has become and then I will continue on simply out of habit. I'm re-reading the myth of sysiphus. this book fully and thoroughly describes the plight of man and the existential nonsense that is life. the absurd. I genuinely struggle to keep doing this shit everyday. I really really struggle man. and there's no one I can really talk to about this. I mean i have a therapist but what the fuck is he going to say. all of the same ass shit that you're supposed to say to a suicidal person. i would not say that I'm emotionally suicidal though. I'm genuinely tired of life. I have no hope. My mind won't let me cheat using religion. I hope for change, I hope for a better future but each day the world takes my hope and fucks it reminding me of my place therein. I've created a nostalgia toat I long for knowing that whilst back in it it will be as empty and dull as when i left it but damn it's better than pure routine and hopelessness of the absurd. This book is my bible and god I'm hoping that if can give me reason to live. Unfortunately for me, I know going into this book that the message therein is not one of hope. It's one of pure logic and insight. stay alive because logically that's the only way to life while acknowledging the absurd and keeping it alive. all other solutions are cheating the logic or cheating the bounds or the knowledge that we are limited in knowing. and god the despair. my soul flounders in the pain of looking out at the world as it is. but i keep going. as a purely logical cunt I hope that is enough to keep me going becasue god this isn't worth the trouble. it just isn't. i don't care to be the hero of some myth. in the face of meaninglessness not all is warranted but all is legitimate."
My 5 Things,2015-12-22 08:01:00,"It was recommended to me in a YouTube video that if I want to accomplish something then I have to focus on that thing. The issue is that I have so many different hobbies and interests that distract me from my main goal of learning what I want to learn and accomplishing what I want to accomplish. That is why I have to pick 5 things. 5 out of all of my goals and hobbies to focus on and get better at to become the man I want to become. The ones that I picked were: 1) Learning how to Debate 2) Game (with girls) 3) Schoolworks 4) Investing 5) Work at GE/ Dow Chemical This is my list for the beginning of next year. In the fall, I will replace work with either work on campus or TV shows/ Movies. Haven't decided and I have time to make that decision. My goals by the end of 2016 are: Have at least $10,000.00 saved in my Ally savings accound and in investments; Know how to invest and have a 401k. and IRA, or a diverse investment portfolio or ALL THREE. Be waking up early and doing pushups and brushing my teeth consecutively for the whole year..... that's a big one Get in a relationship with a woman and learn how those work also sleep only with women greater than or equal to 7 (6 of them if I can manage but 3 as the goal) Get a 4.0 in the Fall -- this is real Get a 4.0 in the Spring be able to debate spead read and flow That is all, My mind has to become a slave to my will."
The start of my writing of field reports,2019-07-08 20:49:00,I am inspired to chart my journey more heavily.
Goddamn. 2017 is over.,2018-01-05 20:39:00,"This year is finally over. I am an old man. 24 is unambiguously an adult age. My life is progressing accordingly. Full time job secured, active nebulous learning plans for coding, music, language, and travel. It's been a good year. If I was going to set a goal for this next year, it would be to keep progressing. Don't be afraid to meet new people. Stick to your calendar when it comes to a scheduled outing. Compartmentalize parts of your personality, e.g. outgoing when out in a new city and quiet and thinking when alone and coding. Practice makes perfect. It would be illusory to try to do some shit all year long but I do think you should really try to do everything at least once a week. I know you get busy but that is not a lot to ask. Women. Onto the subject that has dominated this blog and my life. Honestly, there's not much I can say on the subject already that hasn't already been said. I understand game at a deep intellectual level. I could teach the principles from memory with references to my own life. I have slept with 32 women from all different backgrounds, in different situations, in different mind states. I have accomplished a lot. I have made some of the best memories. What now? This is extremely reminiscent of last NYE post with the distinct difference being that at that time I went out regularly and got results. At year end, I feel myself wanting to go out less and less to focus on other activities that I truly enjoy. The issue is that the less you go out, the more the old insecurities, excuses and creepy behavior Prevent regression in the areas of life that you care about. Nebulous goals for 2018: Continue progress in relationships, hobbies and career. Halt regression in the hobbies and relationships that you care about."
a random girl killed her self. was thought provoking,2022-09-07 01:05:00,"some random rapper, 6000breezy, had a girl friend who killed herself yesterday or today. he released her last messsage to him. that plus scrolling through her IG was surreal because it seemed like she had so much going for her. So similar to myself except even better. family, a significant other, a business, a clothing line (maybe not crazy successful but rollin), she was in the gym etc. It’s just crazy.I read this blog and understand how close i am to that similar shit. I however would never to what she did. I would simply dissappear. no one would ever miss me because they would never find me in whatever village or place that a fucked off to. shout out to dying in siberia bruv. today was tough. not having money to do basic ass shit is retarded and annoying. it really makes me feel so inadequate and want to quit. fuck man. i sink further into my copes and then have to hop right back into work. I am even late for my class now while writing this. It’s true what she said. life doesn’t fucking pause. it doesn’t slow down and it won’t let you take a damn break even at your worst. you just have to keep going."
How to fix peter,2017-10-02 02:20:00,"You will have to start by changing his mentality towards life and women. Start with his clothes. Remove all excuses for rejection until you strip him down to who he is as a person. Clothing can’t be an excuse consciously or unconsciously. Looks, past actions, etc. all have to be ignored and beat down. Start with clothes. Move on to the basics of the approach. Give him some examples to internalize. Persuade him into trying it out and critique his performance and give him advice for the next approach. Aim for 10-20 approaches on this first day. Go with low-risk situations e.g. girls sitting on benches and sets in the lair. End with street game. End the session with a speech. Let him know that this was the first step to creating the new Peter. The biggest thing that will hold you back is your opinion of yourself. Constantly going back and remembering past failures, Evergreen, Eilish, etc. This is your ego riding up and trying to protect your mind from the potential pain of rejection. But you, you need to focus on reframing your mind towards rejection. Rejection is a new start. Your mind every time you approach a woman is this: Hmm she looks attractive, I wonder how she could fit into my life. And if she fits, she fits, and if she doesn’t, she doesn’t. Bigger picture things: I know you feel offended when I talk to you in front of others about this shit. I noticed and I won’t do it anymore. This shit will stay between you and me and if you want others to know, that will be on you to tell them. You have been groomed and indoctrinated by society to supplicate and bitch out when it comes to women. If a woman wants something, you would break your back and trip over your own dick to find a way to give it to her. This is bullshit for a number of reasons but probably the most relevant is that it does not work. At any level. It is not attractive at any level. People want what they can’t have. This is one of the many paradoxes in game that you have to walk in that you have to express that you want to please and fuck a certain girl in order for her to notice that you are interested while maintaining the air that you could give a fuck if she left you right then and there. This phenomenon is known as intent. Establishing intent free of the outcome is the essence of game. This means walking up to a girl and expressing your interest while not giving a fuck about whether she spits in your face or fucks you brains out in front of Woodburn. Get smartphone with Walmart straight talk. There is absolutely no reason why a man should be walking around with a non-smart phone in 2017. Get with the times m8. You can’t. I tried. I brought him out tonight. I am not godly enough to help this man. and he is beyond what I am capable of. I sent him with Parth over to two women who weren't too attractive but it would be good practice to get some speaking practice. I told them that I would time the interaction and come over at the 5-minute mark. Guess what this mutherF did. Parth opened and the one girl was into the interaction... Peter jump in with a ""that guy over there is timing us. He is timing the conversation."" The girl that wasn't into it then goes and walks over to a table of guys and asks them if they were the ones who were doing the timing. They were not and when she returned, he corrected her by telling them that it was me. Suffice to say, the interaction went nowhere. What is it with someone that would cause them to do that? I am literally mind boggled right now even going back and thinking about it. There is a level of self-sabotage that I am wholly unfamiliar with. I really don't understand. This is it. I cannot and I refuse to try to help someone that doesn't want it. To the point where you are actually working against me, this is a waste of my time. I truly hope that you figure this shit out sometime soon. I'm not crossing my fingers. I don't know what happened to you as a kid where you were branded a loser who is routinely disrespected by all of society but who still, regardless of critique, advice, and general life experience, continues on the same path and attitude that got him here. Do you, Peter, realize that you will die alone if you don't change your frame of mind? God damn man. God damn. but hey, I tried. I showed him at least part of a night and he showed me that he wasn't interested in changing."
Level one,2015-08-10 15:25:00,"I’m at level one Who the fuck am I. I am an assimilator. I am a shell of a person who emulates the person he is around the most. And when I am around myself the most I am finding out who I really am. Insecure as fuck. Scary insecure. I feel like there are 3 personalities floatin around in ma at any given time. First there is Chibuzor. He has always been around. That is the little kid who went through some shit. He survived some evil fucking shit under the care of bad people and somewho survived. He is also the little genius. He is the one that can sit and study for hours and hours and feel fine. He is the one that got the scholarships and the internship and the 3.5 GPA. He is the one that debated in college. I don’t like this guy though. He doesn’t know how to talkt to hirls Cheez appeared in between 5th and 6th grade this is the jokester. He is the one that tells jokes and always gets a laugh but at his own expense. He was an entertainer. He also was a groper. He would nad still does, grab or slap women’s asses sometimes tits. He likes to look at girls but not talk to them. He can handle a girl if she came onto him or if she expressed explicit interest but he could not cold approach. Chi appeared in sophomore year of college. He appeared during and after his first cold approach ever. He didn’t know who he was or what he was becoming or what he was capable of but he existed. He became a full realization in Baqltimore dufing the GE Aviation internship. Nights out in blatimoregrowing gamewise with my fellow interns. Those were and are the nights. This guy is confident as fuck. He isi a boss. He isn’t scared of shit. This is who I want to be. I don’t know if I will ever be able to abolish the other tow guys though Fuck this. I’m going to try to be Chi for at least this one last night before II try to work on the confidence of these other guys. One last time. Last day before the merger of all of the personalities will occur. The e will be no more videos. There will be no more coaching. There will only be self actualization and lone wof trips into the wild. Lone wolf trimps in to study land. Lone wolf trips into stock markets . we gon get this or we will doe. Update: I decided to just upload this as is, typos and all. I created this in the moment and I feel the way it came out is authentic."
I almost died today,2016-07-04 17:52:00,"I have had a streak of bad decisions. I have a history of making life alteringly bad decisions that affect me emotionally and financially for months if not years to come. I don't know how to stop. My brain just thinks, ""just say no to everything."" But can I realistically live like that? Haha the real question is can I continue to live with my current lifestyle, and that answer is hell no. I will die before I am 30 if I keep fucking around like this. I need to come up with a system of yes's and no's and stick to it. That way I can increase my integrity while at the same time limiting my risk. For example, this weekend I was planning on taking a trip to Cincinnati and then to Chicago. The worst risk of the trip was that I die in a car wreck. That risk is extremely heightened considering my car can't pass state inspection and I have had a history of sliding on the highway road in the rain. The answer to this weekend should have been a resounding no. Also, my license is suspended and now I will not have enough money to pay that ticket. I really should have gone back to Morgantown this weekend to pay that ticket and return the Comcast equipment that is still out. Right now, I have a ban on myself driving for pleasure. Work and lifting is all that I am allowed to do because I do not have a license. It will cost who knows how much to fix my car and the shitty part is that I am not even allowed to rent a vehicle because of a past wreck I had in an Enterprise car. I am just a confused boy running around in a grown man's world. I make ridiculous decisions and I am not going to have to live with them. The thing is I also make a lot of great decisions and a lot of other risky decisions that don't turn out bad and therefore they don't end up on my radar as a trent towards the bad. It is only the bad decisions that are scaring me straight. I want to live. I want to enjoy myself. I really need to stay at home and read all of the books that I have and learn how to be a great student before the spring. It will have to start when I get back. I have been playing too many games with my life and with my money. No more alcohol for the rest of the year. None. not a drop. I'm not drinking this weekend is wheat you will say to anyone who asks you why. No more alcohol. Going out. I am not sure where I will be in the fall but the fact of the matter is that I shouldn't be going out as much as aI am. I will say that I can only go out once every two weeks. Or twice a month. At the most. I will mark it on my desktop. and I am not allowed to buy a drink while out until I catch up on my mint budget for alcohol. I am allowed to buy clothes once every 6 months up to $200. For trips, a pros and cons list must be made and the days that you go out on the trip count towards your total for the month. If you go out three days in a row, tht means that you will be down one day to go out for the rest of the month. If I am ever thinking, I'm bored what do I do, Read. Read or study for future tests. or code. or learn french the language that you have been trying to learn for the past few years. done. ese are the restrictions that I am putting on myself on penalty of 300 dollars into my savings account upon breaking. also that is the risk of my death if I disobey these rules so that should also be incentive to follow them. I will become the fun straight edge. the cool nerd. oh also....... the actual story of my almost death is that I crashed in my car after I hydroplaned in the rain on the highway. My car did not pass inspection the day before that the mechanic told me that I needed to replace my tires because they were dry rotted."
becoming myself,2019-09-17 20:46:00,"I've decided to take the big step and go live abroad. I'm right now deciding between doing the reasonable thing and living in China and doing the unreasonable thing and living in Russia. To be fair, I have committed wholeheartedly to the Russia deal and I'm already one foot in the door. It is my dream to live in work in Russia albeit in a different financial situation It is not my dream to live or work in china though that is a means to an end when it comes to saving money and stoping the cycle of debt that I've been living in for a long time. I could move to Russia and figure out a way to grind out extra finances by working more often, teaching private english lessons, finding a freelance coding gig or teaching dance. All of those things are very doable especially with the amount of work that I will have to do... 20 hours of work a week is nothing. I would have to learn how to teach english alone but it's probably doable. I'm very tempted to go with the unreasonable option. I will communicate with the teacher a bit more and see if it can be an option to delve into this specific job further on down the line when I have some experience and some cash."
my big 5 personality tests,2017-05-07 16:13:00,"Openness Conscientiousness Extraversion Agreeableness Neuroticism Moderate Low High Low Low took 5 and this is the average (above) What does this mean? Separately: Extraversion - High · Gain energy from social situations – True to some extent. I do go into god mode after a certain amount of social interaction. Short of that though I do come out feeling drained · Enjoy being the center of attention – True. Public Speaking was my favorite class in school and all eyes on me when I’m saying or doing something awesome, is the best feeling. · Like to start conversations – True. I do it all the time · Enjoy meeting new people – True · Feel energized when around other people – True, but I definitely value my alone time. It allows me to find my center and my weirdness · Say things before thinking – I love to let words roll off my tongue. When I am in my zone, this is my favorite. I am often surprised and the fantastic, hilarious things my brain comes up with I find this relatively accurate. There are times when I feel exhausted after socializing, I do like being alone, and I sometimes find it hard to start conversations. For this trait, I think I broke my old introversion to the point where I am now different. I can remember a time where these things would definitely not apply to me. Agreeableness - Low · Little interest in others · Don’t care about other’s feelings or problems – ehh, sometimes true. · Belittle others - This is true to some extent. I do find that I often insult people’s choice in majors, ability to meet other people, political views, etc. Contrarily to all this, I do enjoy helping others succeed, especially with women. I can empathize with others but I often don’t know how to convey that empathy except through logic. Conscientiousness - Low · Dislike structure and schedules – 100% true. I do spend time creating schedules when I am on Adderall or Vyvanse but I really never follow through · Makes messes and doesn’t take care of things – True. I’ve been working on this though it has hurt a lot of relationships with roommates in the past · Fail to return things to where they belong – True, this is the main reason that I los extremely important things. · Procrastinate – Haha, literally procrastinating studying for my Separation final now · Fail to complete things they are supposed to – Untrue, I have gotten better about his and this hasn’t been an issue for a few months. It was definitely true before 2016. Neuroticism - Low · Emotionally stable – True. It takes a lot to get under my skin. I have relieved myself of most of my triggers. · Deal well with stress – True. I came to the conclusion sometime in 2015 that stressing out about things doesn’t make sense and for some reason, I never had an issue after that. · Rarely sad or depressed – Mostly true. Even my worst nights of girl hunting, I usually end up home doing something I love. · Don’t worry much – True except for relationships. And for girls, I know I just need to study more. · Very relaxed – I’m not wired often if that’s the opposite of relaxed. - Don’t view the world as a set of threats Openness - Moderate · Moderate - Semi-creative · Moderate - Ambivalent to change · High - I like trying new things · High - I like new Ideas/concepts - Talk to me about ideas or aesthetics. Jordan B Peterson Speech 1. High Agreeableness – describe success in their lives by the intimate relationships they’ve had 2. Introverted vs Extroverted – you don’t want someone too far in the same direction 3. Disagreeable vs agreeable – Agreeable people will say whatever they think will make the other person like them. The disagreeable person will be found as harsh and unpleasant and the agreeable person will be found as wishy-washy and unable to put up for themselves. Women are more agreeable than men. 4. Conscientious – High conscientiousness is equal to being industrious and industrious people can’t stand doing nothing. Hard workers have this trait. High conscientious people won’t get along with me since I am so low in this trait. They will become annoyed by a mess before I get annoyed. Women are more conscientious than men. Conclusions I don’t think that I am actually extroverted. I’m a practiced extrovert. I have been noticing the way that I interact with people and what I feel when I am in the bar. I don’t generally like being out and talking to new people. I would rather not and I probably wouldn’t if I didn’t have sex drive. When I answer the questions on the personality test, I answer as I would as the person that I want to be most of the time. I noticed this issue early on and I fixed. I know how to get control over my emotions and keep going, despite the stress and bad feelings."

god help me,2020-01-31 15:04:00,"social media is good and bad for me it's good because it has a lot of inspiring stories and people and it really shows you were you can go if you work hard, stay consistent and get lucky. that said, inspiring can easily become jealousy or something even worse - feeling that you aren't good enough or talented enough to make it in the thing that you are trying to do. the biggest issue is that i don't fucking know what the fuck i want to do or be. i agree with tim in that not everyone is special but at the same time, what does that mean for me? on one level, i wish i had grown up in a simpler time - either go to war or go to a damn factory, marry the first girl that likes you back, raise kids and die. it's fucking simple. here i am now with no idea of how ot move forward with the big lofty ideas in my head. it sucks. i'm actually not allowed to think because the risk of drifting into some bullshit daydream of riches and fame is too high. the road here was not easy and the road to continue will not be easy either - so what now?

Oh Politics – Why You Shouldn’t Talk to People about them,2019-09-05 12:42:00,"I’ve been on the firm belief that a person should never talk politics with people that take themselves too seriously… and that category encompasses 99% of humanity so for all intents and purposes, stop talking politics. Are your beliefs worth losing friendships over? Are your beliefs worth losing pussy over? Are your beliefs worth losing your life over? If your life is at stake, for sure, talk it up. But I lost pussy today because I wouldn’t let the horse die in peace and I didn’t enjoy that. Thereafter, while cleaning my car I met a cabbie (one of those people that move people around in a bike) and had a very similar reaction to my socratic method style of having conversation. I was greeted with wrath. Pure anger to the point where they guy got up and said, “Yeah I understand now why your date went bad.” He had started it by engaging me in the street by saying the knowledge can be a burden to those who hold it. He went on to say that he was bothered by the fact that Putin was allegedly developing a new type of nuclear weapon. I proceeded to ask, him why he stayed informed and he said that it was impossible for him ot forget all that he knew. I tried to probe further and tried to branch off into other conversations about politics using the threads that he kept on dropping. He got pissed. He ended this part of the conversation by saying he was hungry, needed rides as a cabbie, and asked if I had any food. I did. I have pineapple. I went to my car, opened one, and gave it to him, which he devoured with gusto. He then looked me in the eyes and said that he wanted to die. He was borderline suicidal and that would make him the happiest out of anything. I tried to ask further and he bulldozed by exclaiming and asking why I was delving into these shitty conversations. When I tried to brighten things with conversations about video games or travel, he shot those down with equal vigor. Seeing no further avenue of communication, I wished him luck, shook his hand, and walked back to my car as he too rode off on his bike. These experiences show me that politics aren’t worth it. I think that there are other fun areas to disagree on if you want to be polarizing or experiment. Politics specifically though is toxic just like religion. People do not want their deeply held beliefs examined or questioned in any way. Doing so brings out their fight or flight mode… yes it gets that fucking serious. Question someone’s beliefs and their voice will immediately become raised or they will find a reason to run away. I’ll be damned if I lose another pussy for politics. I haven’t sacrificed it in the past and there is no reason to start now. Oh you need more reasons to not talk politics???? See below. Reasons to not talk politics: 1. Speaking intelligently on most issues requires you to be abreast of current happenings. Being informed will make you miserable. The news cycle is purposefully littered with negativity because humans respond and click through to those type of articles. Enjoy depression. 2. You could lose friends, family, and or sexual partners because of your views on a specific issue. This said, there are certain issues that might and should preclude certain relationships… for instance, someone’s stance on abortion in the case of relationships with unprotected sex. Other than that, I see no effect that a privately held opinion could have on a person or the people around them. 3. Speaking intelligently about a particular political situation requires evidence and facts. If you don’t have either of those in front of you, you are engaging in the emotional masturbatism of your chosen political parties talking points and resulting in a gridlock of viewpoints and the aforementioned loss of friends. If you are going to engage in nuanced conversation, at a minimum, engage in the proper context… that in which facts and figures are at hand, readily available, and referenced often. 4. Your conversation will change nothing about the world around you. You will argue, possibly lose a relationship and, when you walk home mad and stay angry for the rest of the night, the political situation will be the exact same. Unless you are literally in politics, trying to negotiate or do some other political shit, stop. Just stop. It’s a shame that I had to learn this lesson again after so viscerally being exposed to the folly of my ways back in 2014 with religion and 2015 with politics. But just as I got fired again (from Julii the restaurant where I was a server for a week) for not having good work ethic, something that I developed and maintained after a hard chat with Joe Davis at GE back in 2015, this is something I am going to have to work on. I don’t know why I keep forgetting the value of these life skills that I used to have a good handle on in the past. If you don’t maintain social contacts, if you don’t workout, if you engage in violence, or if you talk politics, you will be unhappy, depressed, and suicidal. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. I’m okay with making mistakes from time to time… but learn from them Chi. Learn from them and put systems in place that will prevent them from happening again. Goodnight."

turning 25 in 6 months,2018-07-29 17:18:00,"Jesus Christ time has flown. It feels like yesterday that I was hitting on 24 year olds and thinking that I was the bees knees by almost getting laid by one of them. There used to be so much status and energy in being 24. I am now 24. This is an unambiguously adult age. It feels weird to think about. I am still the same dude but in the real I am a 24 year old man with a full time job during the week. I still behave like I always have though. Is this sustainable? Who knows. I still live out of my car. I still procrastinate sometimes and I still have nights were I am scared to be social and talk to anyone, much less girls. While so much has changed, so little has as well. I have no clue what I want out of the women that I am meeting and sexing. I have no clue and i am progressing down that path. I know that I want a long term relation ship with a girl. I definitely want that even just to have it. I ant to know what it feels like to have someone that you can always go home to but also someone that being with them behooves that you aren't with anyone else. It would be interesting. Here i am learning Russian, lifting, and playing guitar all in the hope of making myself more marketable to the demographic that I am chasing: young Russian girls. If I am being real, that is what is happening in my life. And I am here for it."
same day: separate matter,2016-12-05 04:35:00,"I meander through the world awake and vigilant to the actions and reasoning of those around me. Their eyes are closed and they are blind to the reasons for why they have come to this place, the reasons for why they drink poison, the reasons for why they all are wearing the same color and allowing their emotions to drift up and down in response the 11 men on a field hundreds of miles away passing around a an oblong object fashioned out of pigskin. They know not why they have gotten out of bed and dressed in their Sunday's best and arrived at this venue so late at night. FORGIVE THEM LORD FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO. The Bible has that line somewhere in there. Just shows that you can find whatever meaning you want in many different quotes and texts. It is here where I live, understanding ostensibly at a deeper level. This girl...... pause from that. I need to get this off my chest. This was what this second post was really going to be about but I was distracted by my other thoughts. I need to start meditating so that my brain ins more clear of debris and I don't get distracted as much. Anywho - I need something. I feel the need to spray words and experiences all over people. Everything i have a conversation with select people or any person who stays in my presence for a period of time, I just start expressing. Everything that I haven't been able to tell someone over whatever period of time that has transpired since the last time I spoke to that person has to come out. I maybe first noticed this when I used to have my long conversations with my old roommate Carly. I would spew shit for hours with her just staring back into my eyes, listening. I knew that really, she didn't care. How could anyone really truly care about what someone else is going through? I guess that is my pessimism of humans coming back. I'm sure it's possible she cared but with the little that we had experienced together and the fact that every person has the same if not greater litany of problems that plague them in the same fashion, I doubt it. The same way I feel when someone is opening up to me and discussing deep things that really shouldn't be talked about given the breadth of our interaction, I imagine others feel when I unload my truckload of stories and experiences onto them. I told myself at the time that I actually didn't care about what she was feeling, I just needed a wall to throw my ideas down on and some pretty eyes to absorb my hurt and wonder, my struggle and my success, my hopes and dreams, and my fears and doubts. I needed that comfort to go to bed happy. She was my emotional sponge that I would let the fluid of my life soak into so that I could survive another week. And then she was gone. Between her and my best friend Nathan Lawer-Yolar, I had it made. I was king on earth and whenever I had an issue, I wasn't forced to conquer it. I could just rephrase some of it and spill it to which ever sponge was closest.They were the therapists that I needed. They were the listeners and through them my brain gave me back the answers that I needed. This blog is my new sponge. My intent now is to use this to express all of those things so that I don't have to disrupt the real world with my problems. Even today, even through I had already expressed my experiences on here, I still felt the need to dump onto Nathan. No more. This will stop today. I will not do it again. I need that power back. I need to take charge of this. Patch up all the holes left on my leaking ship and so that I can become the man that is needed in this world. I want to give hope to the hopeless, strength to the weak, and ostensible love to the unloved. Not all of them of course. Just the ones that I deem worthy. They are the means to my end. They are my meaning. I've been trying to figure out what I want for awhile now, specifically in my relationships with women, but now I am opening this up overall. I want power. I don't want money, though money will accompany the power. I want influence. I want that ability to walk into that club in New York, no questions asked with no one there knowing me. I want the ability to walk up to men and women alike and make them bow to my will without force or the threat of force. That is my path. I know when I am most happy. When I am in God mode and when I express myself to someone who is attractive, introspective, and cares about me. That is really what I want. Can I eliminate the need to unload on people or this blog from my life without exploding or going insane? Yes. Again Chi, only your will can stop you. What happened in New York stays in New York until such a time as you can find a way to chop it up and serve it up as a platter of experience that is stomach-able by normal people and gives value in the telling, the practice of which can take place on this blog. Even in your bliss, internalizing a leading mentality is the priority. It comes up again and again. Building and holding on to frames and being the in the cause and not in reaction, hmm I just thought of something. Last night, I noticed that after having a powerful moving dance with me and experiencing being the center of all attention, women would want to be back with their friends. If I ended up leaving them, when I would return, they would not want to continue the passion that had just transpired. I think that part of this is that when I drag them out of their fun, I expose them to my higher plane of existence i.e. my God mode. When they come down, they feel naked and afraid, unsure of how to experience people in the normal wold. They feel judged, they feel slutty that I would just use them and then left as if they were a 2-year-old's play thing or a dog's chew toy to be touched once and never again. To protect themselves from this, they crawl back into their separate caves of social acceptance that come in the form of the group of girls they came out with. They'll be safe there. When the person that is the cause of this melancholy returns, they have the internal conflict of continuing to an unknown heaven or or maybe hell OR staying in with what they know to be a decent non-life changing fun time. The adventurous spontaneous ones will choose the first and most girls will choose the latter. Chi and the other males who are reading, if you want access to those other girls, you need to master bringing them down from your throne gently, laying them back down on the bed of normal existence, tucking them in with the validation of their friends, and the assurance that one day or hour you may return and gift her the key of future access to your realm. The key to your world is your number, email or card. Your choice which key to give. Back to my problem of emotionally unloading through storytelling, I will stop. I'm not sure what else to say on the subject. My brain flow is nearly empty and ready for my third shift of work. ....This girl wants a relationship with this boy she just met. I don't know why this fascinates me so. Most humans have no clue why they act the way they do. They just exist and respond to their elephants blindly. It's weird. Even knowledge of my elephant makes me think more. Visualizing the my own personal cycle, the cycle of abuse that my dad put us all through, the cycle of civilizations rising and falling, has put me in a place where I feel like I am sitting in outer space looking down at everything. Over the next few months, I will work to put together how all of these things fit together and how to live in response to them but at the same time, even with this knowledge, for all intents and purposes, I am still powerless to the whims of my elephant. Or am I? No I am not. I continue to live with the understanding that there is an elephant but with the behavior that there is none in the same way that I live in a world without inherent meaning with the behavior of a person that has inherent meaning. I will live to understand the elephants of others to the extent that it is possible. I need to get better at understanding and remembering these things since this is really all that I care about now. I see the value of relationships with women. They give you a rest stop from the game to prevent the inevitable burnout that comes every few months. They allow you to appreciate love, joy, and the wonderment that the female sex can bring, shoring up a defense against the misogyny that can build up when you are exposed to the ugly side of their biology that causes them to act in ways that perpetuate the cycle of destruction to civilizations. I see that women are people same as men, who act according to their elephants, powerless like everyone else to stop the way the world turns. Hahahahaah. I laugh at what I am about to say next. I have promised myself this for the past several years and months but still I am a hoe. Next semester, I will try to find a female with whom I can consort with. Someone who I can spend a lot of time with, someone with whom I can practice my manhood around, someone with whom I can continue my journey becoming a person. I have gleaned a lot from the streets and I really really need a break. I could find that break through the complete lack of relationships with women altogether or I can do the break with one female. I will try the latter with serious effort. I mean I will really try. I will really suffer through that dislike that I develop after sex with a woman and live through it to see who I become in that new zone. I'll have to be a God till then though ;)"
depth,2017-02-17 23:27:00,"What is depth? What does it mean to go deep with someone? Does it mean they are able to express their feelings in more than 8 paragraphs of conversation? Does it mean someone that has had a lot of different experiences and can speak to them? I honestly don't know. A girl asked me the question last night: what do you want from me? And that got me thinking... I've gotten that question before and I know that coming from a girl it means that she wants me to lead and take her to go sex. but. That is not what I want. I'm learning though. My interactions with women can't change if I consider that I want to be with a girl longer term than one date. I have to treat them the same. I have to lead, I have to do all of the same things that I am used to doing if I want to seduce a woman. But for some reason, it really feels inauthentic. Every time I express anything more genuine, it comes out and I get a bad feeling. maybe and this might be an epiphany, that is the way of finding if I will be actually attracted to someone. For example, this girl that I met last night, random Hope in med school, was not an attractive kisser. She was a boss but in a bad way. Like she was a bad boss and didn't know how to deal with the people who were under her employ. so so so maybe if I get that feeling after opening up to someone, that is not someone who I really like. Interesting. I'll keep this as a real post because this realization matters. The only thing left is to differentiate between sex talk, or things that I say because I want puss, and legitimacies."
"49 - 34 yo Alexandra, the polish girl who gave up the ass",2018-12-30 02:32:00,"This was another semi violent episode that was spurred on by the girl. I was surprised by how much force that I was allowed to use with her. The spanking was the start. This shit felt like 50 shades. I then went from there to the traditional choking that I'm used to. Then she took it to new levels with the face fucking... she did some porn shit where she sat on the ground at the edge of the couch and allowed me to fuck her face. It was interesting. I didn't really like it too much but there definitely was a power dynamic that I enjoyed. I secretly cummed too fast but was able to pull out and maintain a semi plausible chub and then pretend like I was going soft because of the alcohol. Absurd I know... But I survived. She did CPR on the dick and he came back to life for the round 2. The round two was the ass. Which was interesting. It wasn't anything special... I was expecting the ass to be tighter or something but this shit was just boring and normal. I used lots of lube and technically came a second time... Nothing came out and I basically told her to give up. She wouldn't. She fucking went frantic and went into overdrive into trying to make me cum. We laid there for a few more minutes before kissing and messing around. again. I tried to go in raw but she wouldn't let it happen. Instead she took my hand and hit herself in the face. I took the liberty and did that shit. I alternated between hitting her face and choking her... and fucking hell, there it was.. I came. It took that much fucking stimulation of my brain to get me to cum after the jump. I am currently in Poland. It is interesting. I am on my first trip with other people. It is interesting. While I have recorded a lot of content that wouldn't have been possible without, I find myself modifying the things that I would be doing in order to accommodate the insecurities and worries of others. I am okay with helping you battle your inner demons but there is a point there I need to-cut the bullshit. Bruh, stop making this shit hard. I don't know how you can watch this video and continue making this shit hard. Why are you making this shit more difficult than it needs to be. That was one of the things holding me back from singing in public... It really doesn't have to be difficult. If you want it it be, for sure it will be. If you are chillin and things will go how things will go, it's lit."
Rape,2015-12-17 15:33:00,"I usually just post about hoes an shit but here I have to get out all of my thoughts on this issue. First, we all agree that rape is bad. But where I think we find our first level of disagreement, is on the fact the false accusations of rape are also bad. Feminist response - Well that doesn't happen that much so it doesn't matter and shouldn't factor into the case law regarding rape. Women should be automatically believed because they never lie. There should be no skepticism toward any woman who claims that she was raped. Police shouldn't ask questions about where the girl was, what she was wearing, who she was with, or in any way try to understand the situation any better to better determine guilt or innocence because as we already said the guy is automatically guilty because women don't lie. There is no reason why a woman would lie about this situation because of the intense amount of social ostracism they will receive if they are found to be fraudulent. this is an old post that was in my drafts.... i am cleaning shit out and thought I could post it. it is incomplete. sometime I will fix it"
This is the end of the US - Charlottesville,2017-08-17 18:27:00,"It’s gotten to the point where people are literally listening to an interview that someone is having with someone else and not hearing a single word because he is a member of the rival team. Chris Cantwell explains part of his position reasonably and these people on Charlemagne’s show can’t hear it because it doesn’t pass their screen for the correct opinion to have about race. This will end in civil war and to the extent that I can side with the white nationalists, I will. Fuck this new left. It’s disgusting. You are literally listening to the words of a man who is claiming that his group did not initiate violence. People attacked him and somehow there might be a warrant out for his arrest as a result. And I don’t know if you’ve seen how the police act around armed people, but it is different than someone who is unarmed. The man has good reason to be afraid if a group of men bum rush his door and he reaches instinctively for his firearm. The left has been behaving badly for a long time now from paying people to be violent at Trump rallies to BLM burning down whole cities in defense of criminals, to Antifa burning down whole areas to protest free speech, and now to attacking protesters protesting the erasure of their white history and white identity. They are unable to see past their hate. They are unable to see past their belief system. They cannot be bartered with, they cannot be reasoned with. It seems so clear to me because I’ve cleared the hurtle and am looking back at these anti-whites from the other side. They still have no clue why Trump is president. They still don’t know why Bernie and Hillary lost. This ignorance is keeping this shit going. The silent majority is getting more and more pissed. If you keep poking the alligator in the eye after already getting bitten for doing that shit, no one can help you. The alligator will be your death."
why i should die,2019-09-11 04:26:00,"I can't do anything correctly. I'm the most irresponsible person and at this point, I serve no further purpose to the people around me or the society at large. I can't be trusted with any amount of money for any amount of time. I can't sustain a relationship with a woman. I can't talk to one I've had sex with for more than 2 or 3 days after the incident occurs. And I'm broken. I can't focus on anything or accomplish anything without drugs. I'm dead inside and outside. My brain is fried and simply can't move forward anough to actually accomplish what . I put in front of it. I'm going to try to prove myself wrong tomorrow. I'm going to try against all to fucking work on python with no food and no drugs. Only water and my will to live. If my retarded ass can't sit still and accomplish something, I don't think there's any hope. If I can't accomplish something in python code tomorrow, i don't think there is any hope and I should find a way to kill myself that is quicker than starvation. ***but chi, why don't you just ask your friends for money? well a few reasons 1) It would hurt my soul and ego to stoop to that level to ask all the people that I party and have fun with for money to stay alive. My life looks amazing and awesome and i don't think they would take me seriously. i'd rather die than have the m.o. of a beggar. 2) Yeah reason 2 is the same as 1. The idea of going to those people with my issues is terrifying. The rejection from that is not something I can come back from and I honestly don't know what I'd do with the money besides stay alive anyway. 3) So yes, I really am thinking about it. This is a real blog post and I really am thinking about committing suicide. I really don't have reasons to stick around on the planet. Doing so would mean I would have to become more of what I despise... a worthless beggar who always seems to need just a little big more money to get by. Always just a little bit more. Fuck that. I made my bed. I partied too hard, traveled too much, and saved too little. I became a slave to my vice of chasing women and experiences. Now, I'm suffering for my choices. If I do die soon, I had a good few years in this life. I could combine all of them to come out with 5 or so years of happiness and zeal for what I was experiencing. The rest make it not worth it though. I don't care that life's purpose is life itself. I don't care that it is all about the ups and downs and without the downs we wouldn't be able to experience the ups. I don't care about non=-dualism or meditation. Fuck all that noise now. I lived in the moment and sacrificed the future for too long and look where it got me. Suicidal beside a public library at 12:30 am in Bethesda, Maryland in a car that I've been living in for two years. Oh how the turn tables. Good night.

fired,2019-05-01 17:01:00,"I was let go from my job at Evoqua Water technologies today. I don't really feel anything. I more am thinking about the life logistics around this release. This is not convenient for my business or personal life but this could be the fire that motivates me to push forward harder with trying to live the lifestyle that I've been espousing. I will miss the money. I won't miss any of the people simply because I did not get to know any of them enough to become friends with them. I've been said that I don't do anything and it's fair to assume that other people started to take notice as well. I think I could have done more or kept up the look of someone productive but ultimately this was going to be the outcome at a company and in a career that I did not care for. I don't want to say anything negative... this was just not the life for me. I can't express my personality and I didn't even have the pretence of business to keep my mind occupied. At the moment, the focus is on figuring out what the next steps in my life are. I can become a bouncer and a server in Denver until something else comes up. The big options are: go to work on a cruise or go teach English abroad. I haven't submitted my application for the cruise yet simply because I didn't want to enact the labour to fill in all of the employment fields. I have extra time now so I will get that done today. Other than that, I'm looking at teaching English in China and Korea. I would not need the TEFL certificate for this which is good so, for now, I am holding off on completing this certification. I am not freaking out because this is not a big deal. I can bounce back pretty easily at the moment because of blessings like my car and mind. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."
I'm at a party I don't want to be at - metaphor for where I am in life,2019-05-13 22:11:00,"This is bullshit. It is hard. I started a business a few weeks ago with no knowledge of how to run one of these things. It worked and then I realized that the suppliers I was using all have shit lead times and that my customers were going to end up pissed because they would have to wait 3-4 weeks for their products instead of 1-2. And then I got fired from my job at a pivotal moment in my life when I am planning on how to expand my business based on current income and planning how I am going to use both my current income and business to exit the USA for good. And then I realize that any trend that I start to start is extremely difficult to maintain because of my current travel lifestyle because you have to use uber to get to gyms and that adds up extremely fast and friends always want to drink and eat out and good content and footage is not easy to come by and good friendships that are still mutually beneficial are also difficult to find. And girls are shit as always. And everyone thinks I'm gay. My thoughts while delivering food for $10/h today was what's the point? Jesus Christ, fucking figure out why you are choosing to go through all this pain so that you can safely make it to the next island of life. This shit is a dangerous place to be mentally and if you don't take care, shit can happen. Now, I don't think I have the mental demeanour to do anything permanent but these feelings of inadequacy can easily compound and become something different. So I don't know. My next steps are thus: To put myself on a better schedule by (1) balancing delivering, (2) completing my TEFL, (3) optimizing my online business"
"I’m disappointed, frustrated, scared and upset – Bahamas 2019",2019-04-22 17:06:00,"I am staking out my claim for who I want to be as a person. A strong confident wealthy beautiful black man who is so fun that everyone always wants to be around him, so cool that everyone remembers him and so good at women that his memory haunts them for years after. I am warping my life in pursuit of this goal and now I am looking back at the years of work with this empty loose feeling. Like I’ve done all this shit and still, when I’m on vacation with like-minded people and no inhibitions I still can’t actually close a deal or back up all of the talking. I still can’t walk in the room and validate the belief system that I’ve maintained for the last 6 years. I still can’t keep a girl attracted to me for more than 2 minutes. I am lost. Dude if I can’t do this, what right do I have to call myself a hoe? How can I look people in the eyes and explain to them what or how to live a lifestyle that I haven’t spent one day in. I can’t maintain even one relationship for more than a month much less 4-6 like I bullshit about. I talk from such a place of knowledge and understanding when I am always just figuring shit out and occasionally getting lucky. Up till this point, so much of the sex that I’ve had has relied on me being lucky and I feel like I’ve lost so much more than I’ve won. Where do I go from here? I just got back from a cruise to the Bahamas for Nick Masciadri’s bachelor party. Shi was fun, I got out of my shell, I danced a shit ton, I impressed a few people, I made friends with some high schoolers, and I came back to the airport instead of going to the beach even though I have about 6 hours to kill before my flight. Why? Because I can’t do it. I can’t do the thing that I would want to do If I took the journey down to South Beach and used another 20-40 dollars on a thing that I’ve been trying to get done for the past few months. I am tired. I am hungry. I am thirsty. And I just can’t seem to find relief. I can’t find reprieve or contentedness. I just go form this thing to the next thing to the next thing just hoping that the next one will be the one that stays. And then the next one will stay too and then I’ll be doing the shit that I prescribe. I just keep hoping. I just keep praying that the website will start moving goods. I just keep looking at the bright side and thinking that things will be better in the future. I just don’t know any more man. This is my life and if I can’t do the thing that is my life, what is all this about? Serious question. When will women start to just like me for me? When will I be enough? Do I just need to start walking up and having normal conversations with girls and grinding on that till it becomes real again? Do I really have to get back to basic no frill game? Do I have that setting? I just don’t know man like I already did that shit… I know all of it I know what to do, what they feel, how to move it forward and what to get done. But I’ve done that before. I lived that life. Do I really have to start all over? All fucking over again? Well. At least I have the content. For now, I will settle for the favorites, saves, and comments. But there better be a fucking end game."

No No But every time I hear a romantic song I feel that energy I feel that nervous energy of the world telling me that there is something out there called love That there is something out there called the one That there is something out there goes by the synonym your person and it's up to you not go give up but goddamn I've given up. goddamn I've given up goddamn there isn't any more space left for hurt there's no space left for pain there's no space left for trauma there's no space left for any of that so now we're here **deep breath** now we're here in this space that's been left over by gods, by devils, by abuse, by broken relationships, sad goodbyes, ecstatic hellos, first impressions, and last impressions I am a hoe"
sex. masturbation.,2021-04-07 14:33:00,"my loins ache for release. simple release of porn of a girl getting beat up or that of a vagina directly caressing my erect penis. either will suffice. I resist only out of revolt to the idea that I can't live without the release. it is a protest of sorts. a protest tieht hte idea that at any time, when i deem, i can reenter this world brighter and stronger, in fact, because of my chastity. in the moment though it hurts. my mind imagines that simple release. and how simple it really is. as simple as one 5 minute session in this panera bathroom or one 1 minute session in a vagina. how simple it really is. strange that it is something that truly drives me and the world to do things. If i didn't sex, I wouldn't participate in so much of life. And just in the process of writing this, the need for release is gone. It's like acknowledging the absurdity of such a need put it to sleep. it will come back, just like my suicidal thoughts and depression. I'm strong though. I'm ready for it. I'll take the liberty of release when I want to, not when it's dictated to me by my body."
talking vs being/doing,2021-05-27 19:05:00,"I had a beautiful articulation of why my ego sometimes acts up more at some times versus others. In general my theory is because whey I have long from conversations with people especially about subjects I care about, I tell stories about myself and how I think the world and what it should be. This leads me to getting attached to a specific identity be that of playboy or 'god' or center of attention or attractive person. Thus when I go out next, I am attached to that identity and become somewhat scared of losing it. Increasingly it is easier to let go of specific egoic representions of myself but sometimes that shit gets super strong. The strength can increase when I'm alone and not around people often. There's much more time to form stories and connect with who my body thinks I should be and become attached to a fear of losing that identity or a fear of the change needed to become that person. I often pause videos and life to discuss and think about things that don't truly need to be thought or discussed. most things have been articulated by my brain in the past and this current iteraction of the thoughts is purely masterbatory for my ego to feel 'right'. back ot life"

Britney pt 2,2015-08-03 18:34:00,"Damn. The advice that i just got from Jenna was this.. Just message hey all day and don't talk about meeting up. Then when that time comes you can ask and she is more likely. Fuck. I did the opposite of that. I just get way too excited and send messages without thinking before hand. Hindsight is always gold. Fuck Is it too late Can I take this message back and try to act like someone who is interested in her day as well as interested meeting up? Sit. I always over think these things. My motto should be, if she likes me then she'll respond. But what if the text I sent makes her but like me.. fucking hell. Anyway. I really hope she texts back and I get to see her again. She was so nice and kind. I think what I like about her the most is how she touched and kissed me. It was like she needed it. She held me close and enjoyed my company. No girl has ever did that. I know this is all superficial shit but it's real. I at least know how I would like to be treated by a woman physically. I don't know anything about the virtue of this girl though. My car is that she will turn out to be just like the rest. Christian or liberal or feminist or child abuser. I don't want her disqualified yet. I want to enjoy this for as long as possible before going back to the two world where the probability of finding a good girl is the same as that of finding 100 dollar bill lying on the ground in a crowd of 1000 people who are all looking down. Poetic but scary and sad. I hope she texts back so I can taste one more piece of heaven before coming back down to due with my fellow dogs. Maybe one day I'll get one to keep and it'll be heaven for the rest of my life. Maybe. I always have hour for the unicorn. Always have hope."

"Dear Emily Kennel, (iPhone)",2011-11-11 20:00:00,"Dear Emily Kennel, I miss you. I miss our relationship more than anything right now and it kills me every time I see your beautiful, smiling, happy face. I miss talking to you even though we only really talked about soccer. You're definitely one of the coolest girls I know and I love that you're so easy to talk to. I miss when everytime you saw me you gave me a huge hug, wrapping your arms around my waist and holding me. It gave me feelings I've never felt before, and the only reason I hesitated to ask you out was because you were a freshman and I'm a senior. I don't know, I think I was scared of what people would say or think. I want you so bad and I swear to god I was going to ask you to go to the movies with me last saturday. But i didn't because I'm dumb and the next day when I got on Facebook and saw your relationship status, I knew I had made a huge mistake that I would regret for a long time. All my feelings for you became apparent but I guess it's too late. Ha not the first time something like this has happened but I guess I failed to learn from mistakes. Guess that's one reason I still haven't had my first kiss or first real girlfriend. But anyways, I hope you're happy. Patrick's a lucky guy. cheez"
my behavior: observations,2017-11-15 13:39:00,"Girls aren't talking to me and giving me their numbers and snapchats because of who I am. They are doing it because of the name in the front and back. I'm allowing lux to destroy my shit. Anyway. Independent of that. I have been failing a lot lately. Only with women of course. As per the usual, my personal and professional lives are stark opposites. I took a girl out on a date, spent too much money, and got nothing. I have repeatedly tried and failed to get countless girls out on dates. 111 days since I last put my penis in a vagina. I actually got close a couple weeks ago with Dara, a girl I used to go to high school with. I didn't have a condom and didn't pursue going to my car to get one. Anyway, that experience made me realize something. I saw a girl that I had a crush on at the beginning of last semester in my class. A couple actually. 3 to be exact. Fuck it, I've crushed on just about every girl in this ChemE class. Anyway, the one girl, Sierra or Sabrina (something different, I don't remember) has a boyfriend now. I look at them in 2017 with new eyes. I don't think I would still be with her today. Even assuming the best of circumstances and that somehow I was able to break through the brick wall of second dates and first fucks and see her again, I don't think I would still be with them on account of that I am now disenfranchised by their looks. They aren't pretty anymore and, in some cases, I find the girls downright ugly and repulsive. Their looks haven't changed too much but my opinion of them has. With time, my heart grows more angsty. I can count on my fingers the number of girls that I would consciously choose to still be with today. I think that means I've matured? This could also be a version of post-sex disregard where, since I have canceled these girls out in my mind as potential sexual partners, I now see them for how they really are. Beings flaunting sex appeal and a vagina through the lie of makeup. Whatever though. I will continue on living. I will try to add no sexual release (masturbation) to my celibacy and work on coding, now more than ever. I can make all lives better if I can just focus on this hobby. This article wasn't too insightful but I hope this is an additional marker of change. I am mobile app developer that works for a public water corporation. I am a professional presenter. I am a beautiful man. I am me. I am Chi. Bye now."

field report - 4/30,2017-04-30 09:12:00,"I'm back. Or almost back. I don't even know if I would have closed this at my best but it's lit. I pulled two girls back to my place tonight. Nothing happened but I pulled. I didn't pull the Japanese shiatsu massage routine in the mystery book because I was too nervous. There was too little action. It was almost an asexual meeting. It was a perfect recreation of the story in Style's book. Except for the girls probably weren't as hot lol. They were laughing all the way back. I have the ability to talk for hours about bullshit. I took a picture kissing one of the girls in front of Woodburn even. On the cheek. That is one of the moves that I would've pulled at my best but on the lips. This is one of the moves I am comfortable putting on another man. I got a couple kisses tonight and I got another guy a makeout. This is the exact same trajectory that I hit over the last few years. Except I am hitting it in just a couple nights. Good boy. The same work that you are comfortable doing for others you have to do for yourself. I like how awesome I am. Anyway, I walked the girls up my street and stopped at the Uplace Sheetz. I offered to buy them a drink or whatever they wanted. One of them got food the other got ice cream with me. With this isolation, I should have tried to pull a kiss. That was the first place where something could have happened. Well the second, if I count the Woodburn kiss. I knew if anything were possible I would need to buy condoms. So I grabbed some but I really hadn't built up enough rapport or anything at all to be cool joking about buying condoms. I could have joked about having a girlfriend or something and that I needed to buy condoms to see her later. That would have accomplished multiple things. It would have disqualified both girls making the more willing to open up since they are completely safer with me. Next, I would have been able to get condoms and be safe during activities later. Since I didn't do any of that, I do believe that one or both girls saw the condoms in my hand. It would have been best to have one of my friends come and buy them but nah didn't do that either. It may have put them off. I don't know. Anyway, the girls still came all the way to my place and walked in. I gave them a pseudo tour. At this point, the best thing to do would have been to put on a movie. I don't have a tv though so that's not lit. One of the girls pretended to play my guitar while I danced around the room with the other. At this point, I could have taken advantage of the small amount of energy that had built up in the room to do the shiatsu massage routine. Since I didn't, we ended up sitting there while the girls semi-frantically called everyone they knew in town to pick them up. I am definitely exaggerating but they were not comfortable sitting there. There was no music, no TV, not art on the walls, nothing. All of that would have helped. Lastly, I gave up. I said, let me get my car and I will come back and drive you to your place. I didn't expect them to be there when I got back. I got an uber downtown, picked up my car and drove back, uneventfully. I pulled up, hopped out, and lo and behold here the two girls are, outside of my apartment and waiting outside. I was semi-surprise and I asked, ""Hey do you still heed a ride."" Knowing damn well what the answer was going to be. ""Oh no, one of our friends called us back and she is coming."" I'm a bad person for standing there and forcing them to continue to small talk about zero things. They stammered through excuse after excuse and explanation after explanation with my occasional interjection. I let them suffer. Maybe they have an iota of what it is like to be a man on this earth. I finally decided to stop punishing them and let them get along with their lives. I didn't go for any numbers. Neither were the type of girl I would have any interest in getting to know. They are objects for sex. This is good though. I can see clearly what I could have done better and future Chi can take further advantage of these situations as they present themselves. I have only had the pleasure of pulling two girls to my place 3 times in my life, with two of them being the same two Russian girls in Estonia. Now, those girls were fantastic and the opposite of the trash I brought home today. The next step is to write out a couple routines with the materials that I have or modify existing routines so that I can start to innovate this game that I started so long ago. I'm done winging it. I am way too nice to these hoes. I need more negs, push-pull, and sexual tension. I am way too easy for these girls and that creates a situation where I am just an object and not one they want inside them. Signing off, chi"

My girl issues and Baltimore 8/29,2015-08-31 05:30:00,"I don't know what to do with these girls. I just don't. I've researched and tried for a long time and still haven't had a relationship for longer than a few dates. It's kinda demoralizing. I don't even know if I am even capable of having a deep long term relationship with a girl. The first thing is that I really don't actually like many of them. I heard a wonderful thing last week were someone said something about there being a difference between romance and compatibility. The people that have been critical of me and the value of me telling my experiences were correct in that I may have limited experience with romance. I wouldn't say that I have ever loved a girl. I'm not really sure what that word means anyway. What I have been able to figure out rather quickly is whether a girl has incompatible qualities that would prevent me from spending my life with her. People don't believe that I can tell whether I will buy a ring with in minutes of meeting a girl (if i choose to ask specific questions). Now I'm thinking of letting there be a split between my sex life and everything else. I am thinking about just going for sex and that is it. Let nothing interfere with the sex. But at the same time am I sacrificing my values by doing this? I feel like if I don't try to marry the girl or knock her up, I'm definitely not doing anything immoral... Whatever. My next girl will be the girl that works at Panera. She looks genuinely nice. I'm basing this on mostly nothing but basic intuition. I'm scared though. Even the girls that I have considered nice or reasonable in the past who also had temporary crushes on me have dropped me for one reason or another. I have no clue what is going through these women's brains that causes them to make these decisions regarding my relationship with them. Well I do have some clue. I could probably make an educated and accurate guess on why each didn't feel attracted to me in the end. What I'm scared of is repeating those mistakes. Especially the ones that include unconscious internalized attitudes and opinions that I have developed over the years. haha I mean I guess if the boots me over something that I can't change then we just aren't compatible. It just sucks because I don't want to waste anymore time with difficult things. Also, fuck texting. Actually fuck it. I hate it. I can't live with it and apparently can't date properly with out it. Also dates. I don't really know what to be talking about on the second, third, fourth, and forever dates. I feel like I comb through a shit ton of topics and know a lot of stuff about the girl after the initial go. This isn't too bad though. I feel that I could probably talk about anything for a long time. ah I jus feels like soooo many girls start off liking me and then get turned off by something along the way. like he girl that was in med school that I talked to on Friday, Jessica Patterson. She was super hot, wearing leather and had her pick of any guy that was in the club (which isn't saying too much, but it also is). She was feeling what I was saying and was picking up what I was putting down. She was laughing at my jokes and engaging with my stories. She was holding me while I held her back. She gave me get number. and then she didn't text back. Shit like this just fucks me the fuck up. I have no clue what the fuck went wrong. She's on of the girls that I have no clue what I could have done differently to get. That is the most 'scary' part. Because of this gap in my knowledge that led to my failure with this extremely attractive smart girl, I'm open to future failures of the same nature. This is why I'm leaning toward taking one of those pickup boot camps. I want to learn more about my self. I want intimate coaching so that I know exactly what I am doing correctly and what I am doing wrong. I'm not asking for any routine. all girls are different (even thought they are kinda the same) and every interaction will be unique. I am hoping to identify behaviors that are adversely affecting my ability to sleep with certain girls. Also, anyone that says 'oh just be yourself man' is a fuck stick and should go die in a hole. that kind of advice with girls or anyone or anything is fucking retarded. I was 'myself' for 20 years and it was only after I stopped being myself that I lost my virginity. It was only after I stopped being myself that I started having successes with women and life. Sure, if you are already a boss and have a lot of value, be yourself. But let me let you in on a little secret. In the world we live in today, a lot of boys don't grow up with that mentality and therefore struggle majorly to get anything accomplished in life. So, anyone that ever reads this, fuck your 'be yourself' and help whoever is asking you for advice become a better person. WISH ME LUCK WITH PANERA GIRL :) (her name is Aly) Also, I want to Baltimore after two weeks of being absent but I am really done writing for the day so I'll have to go into that a lot more later."
hi dad. what to do,2016-07-09 19:39:00,"what the hell am I supposed to do. I am lost. I am wandering around in a world that was not made for my kind. I am living in a limbo made for other lords and ladies, in a pergatory meant for other people. Am I supposed to have a conversation? am I supposed to talk about things? what things? what is important? what is interesting? You can't know. Is there anything specific that I should stop doing? I don't know. Are there things that I could do better? Yes. Of course. There always is. But what things? and in what areas should I go out and try to improve. I need a goal every night or I will continue to be board with women and not consider them people. haha. hahaha. I am smiling after that line. I love saying shit like that and seeing the horrified reaction from people who don't know that I am 70% pulling their leg. But the 30% is really that I don't like them. I don't like them most of the time. They are emotionally based people that walk around and are affected by everything that is happening. Which is weird. Since I am not that way. And I don't like changing to have them like me. Well I'm not actually changing. But my mood is changing. Like I have to force a change in state in order to be in the mood to have the conversation. To have any conversation. It is difficult or impossible. but that is not true because I have done it so many times. It's just that it feels worthless all the time when I do it. What is the goal of me talking to this girl? So I can fuck her? so she can just not respond? ew I have been running out of stuff to say as of late. My rambunctious attitude is not enough and my entertainment isn't either. I need to talk and connect more. I don't know how to build comfort. I don't know how to do what kobe does naturally. I'm pretty sure I can create value and that there is an inherent value in me coming to talk to a female in the first place since I look good and since I dance. I can create a moist vagina. dude this is dumb. I am not even saying anything at this point. also here is a video thing that I recorded today talking about stuff."
i feel like masturbating today - edit: met a girl in panera,2021-04-09 00:34:00,"my normal fix of girls getting beat up is active. i just want to satisfy it and move on. i did have sex yesterday but i want more. be back in 10did ityeah often i don't know the point of depriving myself. just pure self control idk. sometimes i wonder if my test will be affected by this. who knows. it takes the edge off of whatever this stupid feeling is. i feel discontent. it's like i din't knt do enough or i didn't do something or I'm behind on something that iI should have done. update:i was social and spoke to this high schooler in panera - her name was carly and she was a nice christian gial with a boyfriend who wants to be a dentist. it was comfortable for me and i was congruent to my mood but there was a lot of uptalk ang report seeking tonality that wasn't great - i guess the goal was more being social in general than to get her IG. business idea - group that is flamboyant and fun and goes out and we invite people to join us in our fun flamboyance to increase their confidence in themselves. It's truly wild to me how many people aren't confident in themselves or hate their own bodies - while I'm pro being healthy and losing weight, I'm also a own yourself and righteously live your truth."
the domino effect,2022-10-12 19:50:00,"fuck man - i swear if i don't keep shit tickt all of life fucks up. If I don't wake up exactly on time, my whole morning is fucked... I don't have time to prepare food, I have to run to multiple busses, I get rushed at Panera when getting my morning coffee or I have to skip that altogether and then finally, I don't have time to prepare for any of my classes (not that I usually do that when I have the chance anyway). Life feels tough. And it's mornings like these that always lead to questioning life and considering quitting. It's not hard when the projects are running and the body is looking good - It's when shit goes south because of one thing and it's hard to get it back on track for that day or week.I just don't have enough time in the day to really comfortably do everything that I want to accomplish.RussianEditingSewingVideomakingEven Livestreamingit's tough. the person I need to be to survive. fuck. I shouldn't nap or give in to sleep before the hours of 6am and 12am. I should use my commuting time to prepare for my survival job or to learn something in the target language. In the off hours, I should be combining target language studies with my video editing and sewing."
Party Boy - Lindsey Ferguson,2018-11-29 18:21:00,"I really do have two sides of me that are constantly fighting a war. Or maybe they aren’t really fighting. They work in tandem to deceive me enough to truly believe in the bullshit that I am telling the new girls that I meet. But it isn’t necessarily bullshit. I really do like the girl in the moment. I really would like to spend additional time with her. I really would like to take her out for drinks (split the bill of course) and frolic in some garden and serenade her with the most recent song I heard or wrote on guitar (haven’t really started writing music yet but this is an idealistic post. Bear with me.).But I also don’t believe women anymore. I literally don’t. I really is the case that one moment they will like you and want to fuck and love and another moment, it’s over or there’s some huge drama problem that you have to deal with or walk. And I would rather walk. I would rather steel myself up so that when the walls come crashing down, the building doesn’t fall with it. I’m done with that.I have instituted a mandatory 3-6 girl wall around my heart. It is maintained by going out, instagramming, and gaming in general. If I fall below that threshold of 3, I need to hustle and go out more until that is reached again. You people are fickle and change you minds and it’s painful and annoying to have t start from the bottom again. Which women never understand. Women operate their lives out of abundance (attractive women at least). Which makes you the chooser and the prize most of the time. As it turns out, you don’t want the pussy ass mother fucker who views you as a prize. Maybe for many reasons, one of which is that it’s dehumanizing, another is that the way that this person treats you is disingenuous because everything, opinions, actions, mental states are on the line to change or morph into whatever will get that person into your heart and bed and keep them there.You want that man that is in abundance. You want that dude that is capable of getting most any girl and, more importantly, girls more attractive or successful than you but still in the end chooses you and continues to choose you everyday in spite of what he is capable of in the world. And for a man to be in abundance, he has to practice poetry. Everyday or at least on a regular basis. This doesn’t mean that he actually has to sleep with the girls that he attracts... it just means that he has to go attract them. Working from that place, he maintains his abundance and the mentality that goes along with that. This scenario is the most amount of monogamy that I will ever be able to offer... a place where I approach, talk to, and attract women for the rest of my life while continuing to choose you for exclusive sex (if that’s what we both want). Now, you will ask, what about the girl? Isn’t it unfair for her not to be able to flirt around? And in general I’d say no, it isn’t unfair because it is literally the default for her to be in abundance. **************BUT, I will qualify that to say that the day I am with a girl and she can’t go pull a dude in 10 minutes or the day I leave her to go to the bathroom in a college bar and I don’t find a guy talking to her when I get back... that’s the day she’s getting shifted down on the proverbial roster.Haha, that’s wild and I’m just trying to break this up with a little laughter but you hopefully get the point. What keeps you around, whether you know it or admit it or not, is the fact that my life, mentality, opinions, face, hobbies, and personality are such that I am attractive to you and also other girls wherever they may be. What has brought me to this point is the personality that was molded by interactions with women over time. The day I stop being attractive to Susan at the pharmacy is the same day you file for a divorce, tell me you aren’t happy with the relationship, it’s not me it’s you, blah blah blah. And don’t get me wrong. I’m completely here for the breakup. I just want 3-6 booty shaped life rafts waiting for me *when* my titanic goes down. lol and love. That shit is a feeling and I feel such niceties after hanging out with a girl for more than a few months. foh that that is only something you can get from monogamy or exclusivity & time. Love comes with time. I do get though that the song is from her perspective and that she is saying that a guy like me couldn't *keep* her with these antics and that none of the interactions that I'm having with her or other women are impactful or meaningful over time. And on that, she's probably right. These interactions are meaningful to me though. I love all the moments I've spent in these streets, the good and the hard times. My aquaintance, if the world were different and guys like me could be themselves around girls like you, I'd have married 6 years ago and might have a kid or two now. As it was, creepiness was not corrected for in my child or young adulthood and now the hard default reset of my life is an introverted wierdo who likes butts and sings high school musical because of a multi year crush on Vanessa Hudgens. Sounds like a personal problem, I know, but I don't even view this as an issue. I view this version of me as a beautiful specimen that I have preserved and studied that has it's purpose in informing some of the fun things that I engage in to this day. But goddamn I have a fear of returning to that man, full time, and to stop talking to women, will do that. The paradox of female BS is that the men that are the most attractive are the most fucked up.. the dark triad cunts who fucked babysitters when they were 9 and who layed waste to the highschool cheerleading team, followed by the fratting and then real world. The least attractive are also fucked up but in a different way where they were either non socialized as kids, or beat down by the propaganda of society into being pussy beta cucks becore being released into a world where women are no longer forced to settle for a nice man with a nice job (which is a good thing). We have to be better... the best versions of ourselves, to make an impact on the sexual market and I'll be damned before I let my shit fall below the line."
Field report - the first romper lay (60),2019-08-31 21:04:00,"Rompers are indeed cheat codes for the approach. That said, I find myself stagnating on the front end of the approach. A lot of interactions just don’t get off of the ground... and one of the things I’m having a hard time with is figuring out what is a natural result of my personality not being for everyone and what is a result of having enough premise, not leading the interaction well enough, or not escalating. That said, when interactions do launch off, the girl is usually crazy down and it’s only a matter of figuring out / solving logistics and logistical problems to prevent the fumble. Such was the case last night in DC. I went out with a guy I met earlier this week, both rocking rompers. In DC in general, because of the large amount of LGBT people, it feels relatively normal to be out and about in these outfits. I started with some standard quick street approaches... just high fives, hype manning, compliments, etc. Closed in on a 2 set who was apparently looking for a lost phone. Energy was great that interaction ended with a kiss and IG close. Didn’t work out because the girls were a bit boring to me and the lack of phone was making the one girl a buzzkill. Made moves into a club. It was 11:30 PM so it was pretty bumping. All of the girls in the venue were receptive to my approach... in 30minutes, I probably did four large group sets (4-7 ppl) on my way through the dance floor. None moved past the dancing though. Until crop top girl. I met her at 12am and she was down from the second she saw me. We started dancing and kissing and I asked who she came with... she responded by saying nobody even though I could clearly see a group of girls staring after us. Indicator that the was ready for a pull. I pulled here to the rooftop venue right above where we grabbed a couple drinks and danced a bit more. Once of her friends joined us up there... she was very wary of me and was telling her friend not to go home with me. My girl insisted on staying with me and told her friend to go home... WIN. But here’s the rub, I still don’t have a place in DC... so when we left the rooftop place, I told the girl that family was visiting me and were staying at my place. I followed that up with a suggestion to grab hotel. Not a good move... the hotel thing should have been pre seeded if I was going to use it. She verbally mentioned that that was a bit sketch. I changed the subject and pulled to a Pizza place where we met back up with her friend from earlier. I platonically flirted and converted with the friend before offering to get them an uber home (with me in it obv). This worked. We went back to an apt where the two girls immediately wen to the bathroom for a conference. They came out and my girl said that she just wanted to go to sleep so I should go... but as a professional, I suggested that we at least get water in the kitchen before I leave. The friend left us alone and I escalated and closed on the couch in the living room. Lessons for the night • Openers don’t matter. Just approach and say hi and trust your brain to fill in the rest • Reinforced the lesson to not give up in the face of what seems to be insurmountable logistics (at the end of the night) Sticking points • In many cases, I need more premise on the dance floor... too many sets stagnated in the platonic fun dancing beginning stage • Verbally, I need to work on getting sets to hook without dance moves Oh shit I forgot! There was some random racism in this shit! When were were walking up the stairs to her friends place, my girl kinda exclaimed and then read the message in her phone out loud... It was something like, “are you finished with the nigger” or “are you still with the nigger”. Something absolutely wild like that. The girl was from Indiana and so were some of her friends so that may explain a bit of it but still. Wierd. I generally think the people are rational or at least they have their legitimate reason for not liking other races. In general though, I don’t exhibit the qualities that I and other people hate in the black community... oh well, no sweat off my dick."
How to move forward,2019-07-09 13:24:00,"I got a hit of some serious shit yesterday. Maybe that is what people refer to as a depression. That shit hit me harder than it has in a long long time. I couldn't interact. It was trash. And the worst part was that I was experiencing this in front of someone who respected me and the image I put out. I hated that. I resented myself on so many levels. I hated my look. I didn't think the romper design was up to the standard that I wanted. I hated my face and teeth. The lack of beard exposes the weakness therein and I don't know how to climb out of that. Lastly, I hated that I couldn't speak to any of the girls that I wanted to speak to. I couldn't push through the mental haze. The strength of this mood was too much and I lost control and went into a deep negative spiral, insulting myself, commenting on what a pussy I was for not being able to talk to other humans. It reminded me of taking too much molly at EDC. the feeling of needing to get away, curl up in a ball in a warm dark place, and be alone was prominent. I wanted to feel good, I wanted to feel secure. I get that feeling when I am a boss and I have it often I think... or if I don't have it, I ignore that I don't have it and keep going with my life. That has been my strategy. My meditative technique has been to show the evil thought or feeling down far enough to harbor a moment of bossitude. One moment is all you need to banish the bad vibes for the night. But I couldn't find that moment yesterday. I couldn't connect. and It showed. Where do I go from here? The living alone might have to stop as soon as possible. I would like to maintain more or less constant interaction with other humans as possible. I am an extrovert and the longer I am away from people the weirder I get and the harder it is to connect when I get back on firm ground. I need clubs, I need roommates, I need people to interact with regularly throughout the day. I know that now. I knew that then but I know that now. I remember Molly from Colorado. I remeber her voice and her kisses. I want that level of chill confident security around me. I enjoy that so much and I can't really find it in any other place other than myself. Push through the pain and get to the other side. The other side is where beautiful women, milk and honey, love and party, and sex and money flow. That is the promise land. We will get there together Chi, you and I. I love you and your energy and your greatness. I know sometimes that shit seems so fucking far away but it's there goddamn it, it's there. You just have to make it to the other side. Talk to you later bruv."
27 - samantha rea,2017-05-04 21:49:00,"Morgantown, WV while living at Uclub Sunnyside. She had a good butt. Attractive when I saw her. Not attractive in the morning. I came in her twice. fucked her 4 times. The first was in her sister's bedroom before we left to go back to my place. The rest were are my place. I met her sometime last year where I pointed at her and pulled her into Lotsa Motsa and told her that I wanted her. That had an impact and a whole year or so later she approached my in the club and went home with me. She reminded me of all this and I remembered after the full story. Funny how you can have such a large affect on somone's life and not remember them or that experience one bit. No one man should have all that power. All I have to do now is power move on hotter girls. A double bed is too small to fuck in. 23 with 27"
YOU - the show,2019-06-26 15:04:00,"This is the perfect show. The tension. The drama. The plot. The internal dialogue. And most importantly it's direct and real reflection of real life as a nice guy and what would be required for a nice man to stay the same and still get the girl This dude has had to stalk her and her friends for months, kill 2 people (maybe 3 there are still three more episodes)... it's amazing. This guy has done everything in his fucking power and the girl still returns to her nature. It's poetic in all the best ways, it's calculated in a weird way, and ugh it's sexy. ""the more you want me the less I want you"" fuck yes. this is it. this is real. Her message to him through the therapists recordings. You can't love a women more than she loves you. If you ever fuck up that power balance, it's over. This man has been living in an existance of scarcity since his last relationship and has had to do miles of garbage just to seduce this woman who, quite frankly, is completely in his league if he was just not a pussy. There is a way to act. It can be faked but not for long. Girls know if you are a bitch. They will figure out eventually if you are the type of guy that gets women, or the type who has to kill to keep them around. And Episode 8 is amazing... Beck only wants him after he stops chasing and sees that he's happy and selected by another woman. It's amazing and real. I'm loving every second of this. And men and women can't be friends most of the time unless the guy respects himself enough to not fuck the girl... And then the last two episodes are some whatever but damn. This is the first real rom com I've seen where the dude is a bitch but still gets the girl because he moved actual mountains and murdered to get there. The easier path... talk to girls for 1 hour every day, take notes on those interactions, buy a course online on how to speak to women, and become a god in 6 months."
Field Report 8/17 - Panera in Parkersburg,2019-09-21 01:32:00,"This was a wild one. It all started when I was driving through my hometown after having lunch with an old friend. I saw a couple that had a sign up that said something about needing gas money near the hospital... I thought about the extra cash I had and how good I would have felt if a random person had helped me out when I was that low financially. I pulled over and asked them what was up. Turns out they just needed a ride back to their hometown (2 hours away) and they were willing to throw for gas money. The woman had just given birth to twins and there were complications leading them to be all the way so far from home... long story there. Cut short, I gave them a ride. After, I went to a Panera to do learn some coding. There was a girl sitting inside when I walked in. We made eye contact a few times over about an hour - between me getting stuff from my car, going to the bathroom etc. I could tell there was some interest but I really didn’t feel like doing any approaching. I packed up my stuff, put it in my car, and then stopped.... I talked myself through my insecurities... Why would I not talk to this random girl? Is it because I’m scared? ----->YES.--> Okay cool. What are you scared of? --> that maybe she’ll think you’re weird or creepy or awkward for waiting so long to approach? --> Cool if she thinks that, just hop in your car and drive home. • And that was all I needed. I rolled in with something about her being cute and kept the open up with a question about what she was studying. She smiled and was extremely receptive. I sat across from her and learned that she was a 19 yo ex phys (or something medical) freshman student at the branch campus of WVU in her city (parkersburg). I said something that led her to open up her instagram to show me her photos. I probably asked her how many thirst traps she had on her first page... that is something I’ve been doing a lot lately. She obliged and I used this as an excuse to sit next to her. When sitting next to her I started becoming physical... little touches of the leg, touching her arm or shoulder when talking expressively. She was open to all of it. I find out through some joke of mine that she was a virgin... cool. Progressed to my mini routine of telling her, “Hey, now lets get serious” and reaching out to hold both of her hands. I then proceeded to ask her mundane questions Like what her favorite color was. She said teal and this launched me into a story about how my high school prom date wore a teal dress (true story) which then also prompted me to tell the stories about how I asked her out to the prom... It went well. I number closed here. At this point, we were laughing, flirty, I had both of her hands... I decided to kiss. I said, “hey you have something on your lips” and went in. She kissed back. Not a bad kisser for a virgin. We kinda talked about leaving Panera - getting food nearby or taking a walk -- she said no because she had to finish her homework. I then asked her to at least walk around the Panera -- she said no bc she was worried about her stuff. I ended with asking her to walk around the island booth that we were in... silly but it was fun so she obliged. We held hands and made out during this mini walk around the Panera booth. I talked about random shit that came up... do you like chocolate ;), what fruit do you like... just random shit. At the end, I kissed her and told her we should hang out Thursday. She agreed and I left. I texted her when I got back and the day after - no response---SUMMARY I’m proud of this series of events on on one level... • I pushed through BS fears and insecurities and approached a girl I was attracted to in the daytime in America -- first time I've done this in this country in years • I kissed a girl in the daytime within 15 minutes of meeting her - first time doing this • I told stories about my past and a more substantive deep connection with the girl -- I've been insecure about this for awhile because girls in the past have shown signs or boredom/disinterest when I've told personal storiesThe other level is that I feel like I should have taken this approach a lot slower or ended it sooner since she was a 19 yo virgin. It seemed like purely an ego thing for me to escalate so far in the daytime with no logistics to fully close (with a first timer no less). HINDSIGHT, the professional thing to do would have been to number close and leave when emotions and sexual tension were highest in order to have a higher probability that she would respond for a day 2 esp. since I knew closing in the moment wasn’t possible. What I’m taking from this experience: • Do way way way fuckin more approaches in the daytime • In addition to screening logistics, screen personality traits e.g. openness and actually USE that information to inform your next move"
42 - Marissa Lowell 2 - I met with RSD,2018-10-11 14:44:00,"I blew off a date with a cute wonderful nice girl for the opportunity to see some of the motherfuckers that I have admired for a long time, namely RSDTyler aka Owen from real social dynamics. This guy has had a deep impact on my life. I remember sitting in parking lots in south Carolina and Cincinnati watching his and julian's videos to pump myself up before going out. It was a whole nother thing to see him in person. He is a short guy. He looks like he does in the videos. But he is captivating. I remember back in the day when I was in Sunday school and there was the promise of a handful of candy for the person who was the most attentive to whoever was preaching that day. And I had no clue how the fuck they picked the motherfucker who got the full handful of candy (hindsight they probably had a rotation), but I remember sitting perfectly still and staring at the preacher for the whole of the one or two hours that the man would speak. My eyes would follow him relentlessly across that stage in the hopes of being the winner of that prized handful (ironically, 10-15 years later, I'm still looking for a handful of something hahahaha). I think I won once. I bring that up because that was the way I was watching this man. I was lapping up every word that he spit and although a lot of what he went over was shit that I already know, hearing it in person was a whole different experience. The authority with which he speaks about this subject is the same as the authority with which a scientist speaks about his research or a salesman speaks about his product. It was captivating. I was really just trying to take in his mannerisms and notice the way that he was interacting with the cute young girl that he brought than paying attention to actual content. In the end, I don't know how much benefit I would derive from going to something like the hotseat live and in person. On one hand, I could see a place where that could take me to the next level and since it's only 300, why the fuck not. On the other hand, is it probably more of the same theory and shit that I already know. Yes. Is it the same as what I watched in the hotseat at home all those years ago in south Carolina. Yes. Do I want to do it live? probably. Tangent, I closed a girl that I met many weeks ago by driving to Amherst and pretending that I had work in the area. I picked her up, took her to my hotel room, watched some documentary a,d pulled up. I did fuck without a condom because I am still very frivolous with my life but it is what it is. She had a mole on her pussy and her clit was out indicating that she has had a bit of experience. It was fun. I would probably do it again. Anyway, it's weird. like I'm trying to figure out what to do with this experience. I got to see my other idol, Kirill in Connecticut and I had a similar reaction to seeing his shit live. I literally don't know how to better their lives in any way so I basically choose not to engage. In my mind, they don't need another cool guy hounding them or talking to them about random shit. The value mismatch is crazy and because of that, there really isn't anything I could add that would interest me or them. I distinctly remember a time in my life where it was important for me to get a question out in a crowd like that. I would wait my turn and ask some pseudo-nuanced question that I already knew the answer to and then watch with self-gratification as they give me the answer I know they will give. It was funny to see other guys still in that place. What does that mean for me? I know that there is shit that this man could teach me on a whole range of topics but at the moment, I don't know what I would like to know. There is a very low value proposition to do his or anyone's program right now other than that it would be an experience that I could take and learn from as far as teaching other men this shit. On a personal level, I really don't know what I could learn from these people. And that's a super arrogant thing to say especially considering that they could btfo me in most sets without blinking an eye. So, who knows. I will probably end up taking the hotseat program if only to learn how to better teach other men this shit. Most likely, I will go become a project manager and see how I enjoy my life through that. edit (11:23 am) I was most surprised at the confidence with which he spoke about his abilities. There was no uncertainty, no wavering, no room for anything but complete confidence in what he was putting across. Reminiscent of Tim Meyers, the plant lead of the biggest site in GE Aviation. The finality with which he spoke and asked questions was a thing to behold. In the same way I thought, wow, I want to be able to speak with confidence on life and my experience in the same way that these dudes do."
she's doing worse than me - meeting new people,2021-04-20 17:32:00,"damn itthis is why you can't have friends on the other side of the fence when it comes to exs. i found out today that mary isn't doing well and that she's tried to come onto my friend who is staying with her. she has notified him that she has sex with someone new almost every day and she is back to doing her meth every week and weekend. this is the worst to me.my whole goal with her was to go on this self improvement track with her. my biggest fear with everything was that I was the one and only tendril connecting her to being reasonable and being a real person in this world with goals and aspirations. and i was. she's gone to the world and i can't do anything to stop it.to some extent i have returned as well. i've had a bang and i've gone out a couple times. it's different to me though. i am coming into these things as someone trying to get to enlightment and whatever that means to me. i care about her so much and it hurts to think that she is dying over there and medicating away the feelings that are remnant. replacing one addition with another. and i'm not this guy who goes back over and over again. truly though as a human with a heart i have to reach out. i am disgusted that hse has had sex with a lot more people. literally that's the feeling that wells up. less jealousy, more disgust at letting go of what you considered precious for something that even for you doesn't satisfy. giving up on this level just sucks and i'm so sad that i hastened her decline or reversed her back to this life that she escaped. i feel evil. i am okay and i'm not crashing out at the moment. my friend made me promise not to contact her until he left the premises. it's wild to me that he might have banged and that he's seen her naked and even slept in the same bed with her. i do trust that he hasn't banged but idk. this whole situation is something from a nightmare. i don't like it. i don't like feeling like there's a soul out there that i've helped in destroying. if she belongs to the world, that's one thing. breaking a girl and giving her to the world is a whole other thing. it's truly the work of the devil and i don't mean that in a spiritual way but in a way like leaving that level of negativity with someone is just evil. i will try to reach out when my friend is gone. i know that it is rough and that we won't get back together maybe ever but i need to just communicate with this person. i want to be a light in this world and to have someone floating around that i've helped become untethered is not okay. i will try. i can't say that i'll fix this. i can't say that i can make anything okay. i can just be there for her like she was there for me in my time of need. i can be someone in life that is doing something representing that she can do anything that she puts her mind to regardless of the country that she lives in. i do love her and i can't just sit here and let her die. i will try. if we reach some sort of thing where we can communicate, cool, i will do it sometimes. i like speaking to her about shit because we come from a similar place of shit. positive- i'm making a point to post something positive about my life for every negative evil thing that a post lol i have started meeting people again. i do need to get batter at ending conversations but other than that. it's been going well. i met this 87 year old guy yesterday. i had me with him before but this was the first time we had a conversation. we talked about the book he was reading and how it helped a lot of people become successful in life. this lead to a conversation about spiritual welfare when he brough up that name of a guy that I forget who didn't have an ego, lived in india and influenced the way he thought about the world a lot. i ended up purchasing both of these book that he mentioned along with a third that he mentioned today. i met a 30 or 31 year old black dude who's super into real estate. we connected a lot on the grind and second stage of life, having goals, and planning for hte future so that you don't have to work till you're 65 to have a good life. lastly, today, i met a 25 year old videographer who works for yahoo and verizon media. we connected because of my wild setup and she was interested in what I was doing with all of it. it was fun though at the end it was a bit awkward to end the conversation. i think in general it was harder to connect with ehr because of the difference in genitalia. that's so strange to me. if she had been a guy, we would have had such a different experience. anyway, back to life now. i'm goint to put it on my schedule to talk to mary next tuesday at 12pm."
what i never thought of,2021-06-20 07:13:00,"what if i'm destined to live a boring chill lifewhat if i've been fighting what is inevitable. this thing that i hate so much. that I'll find a girl, maybe mary maybe someone else, and just dance sometimes, become decent but probably never do anything with it. and just have a small side business that never makes crazy money and have kids and do all that shit and just be a normal person with a life and a job building stuff and whatever.what if i'm not meant to be rich. what i'm not meant to be famous or an influencer. what if my demeanor and everything that i want to do and have been fighting against is just fighting against the grain and my true nature is that of a chill family man. never thought about this but it makes sense. i mean how many crazy fun cool people are there out there that just live their lives in obscurity. while my ego fights daily to be noticed and seen maybe that's my destiny too. I might be sad about that but if that's real, i guess it actually makes a bit of sense with my aversion to doing things."
i hate women but not actually (read whole thing),2017-04-16 07:33:00,"not all. But as a principle, yes. They are lesser emotional creatures that don't deserve me in any capacity. again, not all. but most. very much most. I haven't been triggered in awhile but it happened today. I was talking to my friends Seth and Nima while walking up High street. Nima was complaining about women as usual and I brought up the fact that while Buckhead in Atlanta does have more and better bars as well as more attractive women, changing your location isn't going to change shit. Don't think that your game is bad just because of where you are. If you fly to England or France, you will have the same pull rate (zero) that you have in your hometown. I say this from experience. He then brought up that that will be hard for him because he doesn't have 'Buckhead money'. In response, I say just drink beforehand. He responds, ""What does that mean?"" I say, ""I used English in a sentence, it means what the words mean..."" He says, ""Okay, am I not going to buy drinks when I'm out?"" and then we get into a discussion about buying girls drinks. I explain my point of view that as a general principle, you shouldn't buy girls drinks. They have their own money, their own jobs, their own shit. Treat them with the same respect you would a man and respect their hustle as they should respect yours. She doesn't deserve your money because of some antiquated societal expectation that the man should pay for everything. If y'all really want to do that, go back to the kitchen, learn how to cook and clean and teach, and get ready to be a stay-at-home mum. If not, fuck off, you don't deserve my money. I tried to make it clear that I was not arguing an absolute, only a mindset or frame to come from. If you are coming from a frame that you need to buy a girl a drink to figure out if she likes you, you are just wasting your money. There are much better, cheaper, easier ways to tell if a girl likes you. Eye contact, tonality, body language, IOIs of any kind, is she into the conversation etc. You don't have to throw money at her face and poison in her body to figure out whether there is a future. Anyway. Nima argued the opposite POV. Meanwhile, there are two girls walking behind us, very close. They decide to drop into our conversation with a quick, ""It's common courtesy"". I disagreed and tried to explain that you shouldn't have that expectation. If you work, have some respect for yourself and pay for your own things. I was talking along those lines when one of the girls piped in and said, ""I've been talking to you for 30 seconds and I wouldn't sleep with you."" and my friends start woo girling. They start yelling like I just got heavily dissed. Automatically pissed me off and put me in a position of loss. If I react, I lose the frame and become the Chode. If I don't say anything I have no comeback to this quick little quip. Fuck her she doesn't get the last word. I know 800% that that was my ego and I am fine with that. Fuck that girl. whore, walking around with spandex shorts at 3 in the morning. Have some modesty and some respect for yourself. I was triggered in that moment. I started flowing. ""Okay? why should I be upset that two 12... 18-year-olds don't want to fuck me? I've fucked way more girls....... something something... "" I don't even know. All I know is I was yelling. I was pissed and annoyed that this trash would have the confidence and the gall to approach me in any way and that my friends would aid and abed this nonsense. Fuck you, fuck them, fuck you all. Don't back niggas or anyone into a corner where all they can do is lash out. That is a very dangerous game. Lots of people have died over dumb shit because they decided to keep shit talking to a grown man who is bigger than them and could easily beat their ass. God damn if this was Saudi Arabia, I would have just gone ahead and chased them down and got a couple hits in. Channel the inner Chris Brown. Guys would never speak to me that way because they know damn well they are liable for their words and shit like that will get you hit 900000%. Even for me, a general anti-violence guy, if some piece of shit is disrespecting me and is bain abedded by the people I'm with, he's going to regret it. I am experiencing a semi nigga moment right now. I wish I would have called her a nigger cunt. That would have been fun to see that reaction. There might be a bit more to the story, but you get the gist. I argued with Nima and Seth on the way home. White Knight. I hate white knights. I hate guys who put it upon themselves to always come to the defense of women, regardless of the argument. That is what got me. That the people that I was with default to the women's side of things... There I go. That was the real trigger. In addition to the girls, the white knighting is unacceptable and I wouldn't have positively identified this if I wasn't writing this out. That is the purpose of this. I am my own therapist. It has been impossible to put my finger on why I hate different things that Nima does all the time and this is it. White Knighting. I love my brain. Anyway, as far as girls go, the idea of them is almost always better than the actual thing. I love watching the videos of PUAs pulling up and I love the memories that I have of doing the exact same things. I will always cherish those experiences. But it is also those experiences that are holding me back from moving forward. Every time I see an attractive girl, I feel the weight of all the tries I've ever tried, all the game I've ever played, all the struggle I've fought through, all the times I've failed, all the times I've won, all of the LMR (last minute resistance), all of the videos, all of the shit tests, all of the lessons, and the answer is no. No, I do not want to talk to this girl. It isn't worth it. It isn't worth the time that I will spend in the next 2 minutes to 2 hours. It's not worth the number that normally doesn't respond, or responds and then is infinitely unavailable, or the favourite: read receipts. Beautiful. Beautiful pain. Beautiful in the sam way watching a bomb go off that killed tens of hundreds of people. Evil, bullshit, awful beautiful pain. It's not worth the coffee, it's not worth the dinner, it's not worth it. The chances are so low, why would you even try? Sure if you are in a different place with nothing better to do and a life to live, do your best and fight through rejections and bullshit. But when your time becomes valuable i.e. study time for ChemE, it's not worth it. Lifting, eating right, cooking, guitar, work, school, guy friends, all take precedence. I hate those women that I met today. I don't hate all women. I dislike a lot of a certain type. For the rest, I don't have the time or patience to do it. I went out tonight solely to help my guy friends game. Nima semi begged me to come and told me to hurry so I literally ran down there. I was sweaty and I arrive and there are no such girls. I wish I would have stayed in. But if I had stayed in, there would have been no Jenga, no Ben Blemmings, no story for the future, no insight into my annoyances with Morgantown crews and Nima, and no documentation on why I look at women and feel the things I feel. So no, I don't regret it or actually wish that. haha take the energy from a nigga moment and create something of worth. good job today man. I'm proud of you."
what the fuck to do,2023-05-11 05:14:00,there are so many things that I can do right now. I mean there are 3 ... well 4 now projects that have been cut that need to be sewn. there is at least one video that needs to be edited for money. not to mention that I should start producing something
43 - holly arcadiapane the lesbian,2018-10-15 15:09:00,"Had sex with this girl in my car after a long day in a pickup seminar followed by a night of game. It was a fun night where I met this girl. Danced with many others and would have gone home with a ukranian but ended up going home with this one instead. It was fun. The feedback I got from this girl was that she noticed me immediately when I entered her sphere. That was interesting to me as I generally view myself as invisible or only visible to the people immediately around me. Ther is obviously not the case especially as I get larger and larger in life but it is a mental thing that I have gotten accustomed to esp. When I go out alone and don't speak to anyone. There is literally never a reason to do that anymore. I know who am, I know how amazing I am, and I know what I have to offer the community. My next step in personal development is doing an open mike on guitar. That is a big thing where if i think if I can jump off on this thing, this skill, that I have been hiding, I will feel better across the bored. It is something that I really have been holding back simply because of fear of not being consistent and fear of messing up. I know that messing up will lead me to practice more and the quicker that I actually get out there, the quicker I can learn from my mistakes and become a better person. That goes with personal and professional life. I'm scared as shit but here we go. Date tonight with tanner gresham the wonderful confused socialist from my last post."
god women are beautiful,2023-02-14 08:03:00,"I'm feeling a lot of anxiety about livestreaming tomorrow. I don't fully know why I put myself through the mental torture of public wylin... it's terrible but lord jesus if I get on a roll, it can be so fun and fulfilling. In general through, fuck.The french girl making the tutorial was extremely beautiful. so beautiful in fact that I had to stop working for the day. I am on a nofap diet indefinitely and god. She's so perfectly proportioned. Skinny. Feminine and soft spoken. It's so attractive. I want to cuddle her. I want her to like me for who I am. I want her to motivate me to be the greatest but also be cool with me where I am. She's everything. My heart yearns for the sweet comfort of a woman's bosom. I always remember Daniella. God. She was so nice. Spending time with her was so nice. She was so genuine and kind and knowledgeable about her body and what she wanted. I miss her. I miss all of my Russian girls. I miss the nature girl from Boston.I'm not sad.I yearn. I desire. I used to give in and get rid of this feeling by masturbating to some nonsense. Seeing beautiful girls who I haven't earned the right to see naked is a pleasure. It feels wrong and that gives the act an extra zazz. Finding a girl who's posted nudes on the internet and going out of my way to find them without paying... I like this. I like. It is what it is. I will just sleep it off - dream of what life will be like in the future and reminisce about how it was in the past. Where shall I go!I just wrote an email accepting the job offer in Moscow. I want to go back. Well I haven't accepted the offer yet. I have to send something today since it's been 7 days since I recieved the offer. I will accept it though I don't know if I'll go. I feel drawn to that place. It's the only place I've ever felt home. Interview for Montenegro tomorrow... Peace Corps. Idk why I'm doing that even. but whatever, it's a thing. Would be a cool experience probably. I really want to figure out how to live the way I want to without the man though. That's the dream. Freedom. I just want to be free in the homeland.Goodnight."
man i feel like dying all the time,2022-04-19 11:40:00,drmatic but it is what it is.There just seems to be so much in between me and where I need to go. each thing seems like a damn mountain even through the next setps are so damn simple. My brain is in full self sabatoge mode and I'm unsure of how to stop the slope down into deathand I really mean death. I need it to be that dramatic because money is running out and if I can't figure out life or at least continue on my path.... well I guess even in worst case scenario I'll be fine.My body is just reacting so heavily. It's a trick. a trick to push me into enough inaction to force me into another month of comfort here. I won't fall for it. I will get throught to the other side. I will succeed in youtube and tiktok and get to do the things that I want to do. I won't fall for the tricks. not today satan
my business ideas - hoegwarts,2018-11-16 04:20:00,"I envision a world where I practice what I preach full time. Every single day, I wake up, lift, learn something, speak another language and be social with everyone. The goal would be to make game a full time thing. No more bouncing in and out of the lifestyle. Just full time go ham at this shit. I have stated that I have wanted become great at game in the past but I realized something recently... I am good at game. haha to be honest, my body just had a physical reaction to that thought running through my head. But it's true. I'm not as good as I'd like to be but I am good enough to get laid at least 12 times a year. Not a lot but enough to put food on the table or an ass in my bed as it were. The difference here is that I see an opening... The gap between good teachers and bad is huge and so is the gap between teachers who are themselves good at the craft vs. others who just professionally talk the talk. I realize the difference myself in singing where I went from a guy who was not bad who was in a band and who could get people generally off the ground as far as the craft goes to a man who is not only passionate about the craft, he's fucking good as shit. Juxtapose that with my first guitar teacher who was amazing at the craft but lacked the ability to bring himself down to my level to explain concepts and to give exercises. I could teach pickup. I could also travel for a living and give people an eye through which to see the world. Many people never leave the block they grew up on (exaggeration) where I am traveling thousands of miles away to have these experiences. Everyone all the time wants to know the places that they should go and the things that they should see. There's a whole community around it. Saturated as fuck. And this community has a ton of competition. It would be hard but still doable, I think. The third thing that I want to do is sing and music. I love sounding fantastic. It was always (maybe not always but for a long time) a dream of mine to be good at this shit and it is now a point where I am approaching competency in guitar and competency with voice. This is also a hyper competitive field (very much understating that here). Though that is the case, I think that going somewhere where I am in the minority as an american with dark skin would put me over the initial hump just by dint of being different. If I could couple that with talent, an online presence via facebook, instagram, and twitter (though I don't know if I'll ever do twitter again), I could make it. There are other interests that I have around coding, engineering, and project management but those are not the places that I want to stay forever. I like to travel and experience things. These issues that we come across that we have to solve like working with difficult people and not giving up on a project when you know it's a good idea are wonderful albeit taxing to work though. There is a reward there to get though a stint somewhere knowing that your mark and legacy will continue for the foreseeable future. I love that and giving the corporate life up will not be easy. There is a level of comfort that I've grown accustomed to living in the US. Decent job, the ability to get myself out of a hard place by driving my car around for 7 hours. There's a weird fear and nervous excitement to not know what's next. What's around the bend, what situation or life experience can I create for myself by putting myself out there and exploring the world for what it has to offer. I may never be a millionaire but I don't even think I want that. There are experiences that I can have on a regular basis that can bring me a different level of adventure and status if I just let go and go where the world will take me. I sound so liberal and woo woo right now but I really am interested in taking a weird step and doing something else. Teaching game, travel blogging, fashion modelling, and playing music. I am just a regular old narcissistic LA girl. and that's fine. pursue your dreams my man. Who knows what idea you could ocme across to improve the lives of those around you. God speed, God"
Didn&#39;t go yet,2015-08-31 19:55:00,Haa now I'm spamming my own blog with nonsense. I mean technically I did go and I didn't see her so I mean I'm still going to meet her I'm just taking another break before my second try I don't like this feeling. I would like to be way more chill than I am. I feel like a kid. I feel like I used to. I'm putting a lot more pressure on this than I should be I'll go though I promise
Dr Strange Review,2016-11-08 16:16:00,Haha one of my first things on here that has nothing to do with females
i miss mary today,2021-06-14 15:44:00,"i shouldn't have sex. I don't want to blame that but lord, chi, look at the signs of stuff. I'm not sure what it was... maybe just that that conversation veered into territory of mary. maybe it was that conversation about ideas put you further in touch with the ego and that's what that nigga feels often. I don't know. I do know that I would love to run back to her. God."
the pursuit of comfort at the expense of comfort,2019-12-22 23:04:00,"This will likely be my last post of the year. I haven't written in this place in awhile. Long story short is I've been vibing in moscow. 6 girls in three weeks and one threesome. everytime I enter a venue, it's a damn vibe. I've pulled the majority of the times that I've gone out. I have become everything that I've wanted in the game. I've accomplished a lot and I continue to kill shit like I'm getting paid to do this shit. except I'm not getting paid. in fact I haven't gotten paid since I've been in this country. That is the ardest part so far... I'm balancing and teetering on nothing. and now I have this wrench thrown into my wheel of not being able to bring girls home to my place. this is the biggest setback of all. and I found a new place. I found one for 30k rubles which is about 500 usd a month. the issue is that I have to pay for a lot of other shit in that first month and the total is going to be more like 8-900. I still have like 2 weeks till I get paid and all of that money is going towards this new expenditure. that means that I have to survive 6 weeks until my next real paycheck... more than half of which AGAIN is going towards rent.. and it is the same for march. So to summarize I have to survive 6 weeks on 300 and 8 weeks on 800. woah that means 500 rub or 7/day for the next 6 weeks.. which is basically not possible. goddamn like one date thing is $17 at least. and fuck you still can't take them anywhere goddamn it so fuck. it just feels like a waste to be out here not doing these things. that is why I've been sending out apps semi aggressively. I am still too lazy to fill out apps on individual websites but i've been on hh.ru like a motherfucker. no luck so far... only one offer from a telecommunications company offering me 69k to work 18-3 from monday to friday. it might be the thing to do though. I could say I have sales experience after wards... it would be a fucking bitch to get through those days and it might burn me out but it may be worth a try for something to keep my head mostly out of the water. this being the case, i would have to sacrifice all of my social hours which I'm not willing to do right now. I know that everyone else that isn't a millionaire in this country sacrifices a lot to be here and to stay here and have the opportunity... that said, I've always been trying ot break that trend and break that rule. We'll see if I survive. The good part is, most of the girls that I've been pursuing are already in the bag and all I have to do is carry them 'home' as it were (if I can find the money to get the place that I want). There is not much else to update. I really need to figure out what I want to do with my free time. I should be learning to program or how to follow choreography or how to do photography since all of those things are areas that I could work if I would want to stay in russia. very lucrative especially programming. I don't stick with anything though and like jack noticed I have a character flaw of fucking with big things in life and taking big massive risks that can affect the trajectory of my stay here or the trajectory of my life, in the case of condom use. One of the reasons that I came to russia was for the chance to 'change' and become the type of person that sticks to something for the sake of the love of the place. For the vibe for the dancing for the friends for the love, can I sacrifice a few weeks of sex for a lifetime of such experiences in this place? haha maybe not. so stupid. so i don't even know if I have goals. my goals are to make more money in russia so that I can make my life more comfortable here. learn russian to make my life more comfortable here. and pick a hobby that will bring me more contextual fame thereby making my life more comfortable here. The pursuit of comfort at the expense of comfort... the paradox of paradoxes."
the changes are coming,2019-07-14 14:15:00,"Met a guy in the bar yesterday that really talked some sense into my body. Damn. He doesn't drink and he is just grinding out in life until he reaches the goals that he's set for himself. I have met people in my life that have consistently killed it and have been grinding on a different level. I would love to do this. I would love to get to that extra level but unfortunately in the past I have not been able to get past the door on it. Too many things in life that i don't want to give up. The biggest thing is game. I have been doing this shit for so long. I am addicted to it. I don't even get into my game bag that much anymore but the general idea I just can't let go of. There's just always a hotter girl, a better party, a wilder city, a new country. I've been obsessed. Obsessed to a place where it has made my life exponentially more fun, easier and also more difficult. The number of things that I procrastinated on for the opportunity for sex with a woman. The opportunity cost is immense. And I have to ask myself, is it worth it. the women thing is part of what makes life fun and that said, it has consistently been the thing that makes life more difficult since I'll approach instead of studying, instead of working, instead of learning a new skill, instead of suffering through the pain period of the skills that I want to learn. Where do I go from here? One more all day all-nighter followed by routines starting Monday. It's a lot. I'm scared. I'll be the first fucking person to admit it. But the only way you can life the life that you want is to make sacrifices to your bullshit complete lack of security and structure. You need routines. You need discipline. You need principles for how you are going to live. I'd like you to do the girl thing. I'd like you to do the partying thing. I'd like you to do the romper thing and the wholesome hoe thing. I like the idea of the life that you've built. I just think that there's a better, healthier way to do it. We'll talk soon."
what does the word black mean to you,2021-06-09 18:52:00,"My 2 cents -> I don't really consider myself 'black' because that word in the US implies a culture, a way of behavior, and even political ideology and a way of thinking. Truly, I have more in common with immigrants and even white people than the typical American black person.﻿﻿Also, elsewhere in the world, interestingly enough, colors aren't really used to identify people... it's really only in the US like the guy in guy in the tan shirt said. People (in Africa, Europe, South/Central America etc) identify with their ethnicity and where they grew up much more than with their skin color. ﻿"
women will be my downfall - i can't stop,2020-01-03 19:03:00,"Jesus christ, i really can't stop. I need to stop in order to get shit done but I'm addicted to the game. I anc't get enough of the chase of new girls. I want more. Even when I'm not-going out I have old girls to water... even when I don't have old girls to water, the dating apps start bearing fruit. I literally can't just chill for a minute. There's a badass fucking bulgarian girl on my shit right now. 5'11'' tight body probably still has the accent, ready to fall off of the tree. It might be hard to get the close because of the logistics but it is wholly possible and I live for that fucking challenge. Holy shit I'm so excited to try. I shouldn't though. I am looking at spending more money, not only to get down there but at least 30 on drinks at Calico and then at least 30 or more to get back to whatever domicile i choose. lord knows I should choose to get an airbnb to keep the dick safe. so now we talking 1-150 bucks for a new pussy. goddamn. Idk. three problems that I always have that need to be solved - last minute places to take a girl to get laid (airbnb but for hooking up) - last minute or same day dog / animal rental as a pull shtick - hoe management app"
depression and hopelessness,2020-09-23 08:13:00,"I've written about this before no doubt. but damn this thing we call hope really holds us to gether. The idea of a better future. The idea that we can improve ourselves with or without help keeps us going through the best and more importantly, the worst of times.The worst of times for me is when I miss something that I should not have missed or forget something important on my schedule. It is reminiscent of all the times in the past when I missed something important on my schedule and it fucked with my life. I have a casual relationship with time and my schedule. I've tried to make that relationship serious with time but I, up until and including now, have been unable to the detriment of the people around me. I always say something like no one gives a fuck about me (or you) in general since they are more worried about their own problems and issues. This is not true. People can give a fuck about you and even further, to the extent that it interferes with their plans, random people can give a fuck about you. I was supposed to have an 8am class today. I missed it again... this is the 2nd or 3rd week in a row that I have missed the wednesday occurrence of this class.When I wake up and see that I once again have wasted people's time and dissappointed them, I feel hopeless. I feel like no matter what I do, the real me, the person who is a piece of shit is always alive and well. I remember the time Dustin and I made plans to go to pittsburgh and he sat outside of my house for over an hour while I slept. I remember when I missed my senior year sectional championship track meet because I slept too late. I remember when I missed three flights in a row trying to fly back home to colorado or whereever the fuck I was going. I remember when I lost my passport and missed the first flight to Russia and then, when I got my new passport, I arrived at the airport too late to check in and missed the flight again and had to borrow $300 from a friend to buy another flight. I remember when I woke up and realized that I had missed a chemical engineering test that was worth 25% of my grade and had to drive and run to campus and beg the teacher to let me take it anyway. And these are just the big ones that threw me into immediate onset hopelessness, numbness and depression thereafter. There are hundreds of incidents - girls I told I was coming but arrived 15 or 30 minutes or even more minutes late. Friends who I made plans with who I completely forgot about and slept through or was unable to attend properly because I double booked the night and planned on escaping the first plan early but never ended up being able to in time. All of the uber and food delivery instances where I ran 2-3 apps at the same time which inevitebly led to location and time conflicts and led me to be late or a canceled ride. And now english classes where I literally teach fucking 20 hours a week and somehow still manage to miss 10-20% of my classes every couple weeks. It's disgusting. This shit has led me to lose many potential relationships and job opportunities. And thinking about that history just brings me into a state of hopelessness. I try to stay in the now... That's why I love the dance classes, dancing, the club, meeting new people, and hanging out with friends. There is no thinking. There is no problem. There is no depression. There is only sweet life. Or at least just no depression. When I am doing things, it means I'm winning and when I'm not doing things there is danger that something bad can happen or that I will miss something I planned on not missing. The solution to all this is that I need to stay busy. busy and working at the level I was when I was working at a company. I was mini depressed even back at evoqua in denver but it was something. I can't live like this. maybe i will need to move back to america and get a job."
the breakup - tanner gresham,2018-10-31 12:30:00,"I think it was a combination of me being a beta cuck most of the relationship combined with me being younger than I insinuated throughout the relationship. I now remember the reasons why I had certain rules. If a girl saw my did and didn't fuck, I wouldn't see her again, or at the very least I wouldn't be the one to contact her first again. This was a protection against myself. I knew how beta I could possibly be. Having that rule took me out of that general mindset of begging or supplicating to get what I wanted, whether that was a relationship of sex. You always want to deal with people in a position of power. I really did have a better understanding of who I was and what the risks were. That being said, I needed this backslide to get that further correction. Never ever slack on those principles else you risk participating and doing actual behaviors of a beta male. Eating a girl out, paying for dinner, and paying for drinks for nothing in return? I know that I just criticized this mentality on my OneNote so this rings a bit hypocritical. My qualification is that generally one should have expectations for how they want to be treated by other people and more specifically by the opposite sex. There are certain behaviors that are indicative of larger social standing and the ones that you just outlined are behaviors of men who do not have anything to offer women other than their presence and servitude. Relationships of all kinds are a two lane road and you should have expectations for what that behavior shouldn't look like. I am not MGTOW. I am a person who wants to get fantastic at talking, pulling, and having sex with women. It was a goal of mine in the past and it has become a goal of mine again. Literally any deviation off off that goal toward relationshipping with that specific idea in mind can and will lead to supplicating which will lead to the soft rejection of the friend-zone or the whole, ""You are a beautiful, cute, fantastic, funny person with a a good job who is fun to hang out with. That being said, I'd like to not hang out with you further."" That kind of shit. And then the reaction to that which is to preserve the relationship on the amber of a friendship, one day to re-emerge to create fun in our lives that resembles the greatest theme park the world has ever seen followed by a crash as we underestimate our ability to control these wild animals that we always have been... that reaction is another thing that I should start eschewing for all that it is. If you want a specific type of relationship with someone and there is no barrier to that relationship but they are denying that, moveon.org you cunt. I learned a lot in the past few days. I learned that halfsie-ing life will lead to mothers and even women accusing you of serious crimes. I learned that letting go of the principles of old that were put in place for a reason, can and will lead to backsliding into beta mediocrity. It's so interesting that this girl gave me every opportunity to show that I was a leader of men and women. She wanted to know if I was sexually experienced, she wanted to see if I was the boss of my domain, that I was unashamed of who I was. Instead I opted to give her the picture of what I thought a girl like that would want. a stable genius who hasn't had a lot of sexual experience that could be all hers. I had no true intent of becoming exclusive but the idea of having that pseudo-exclusive thing on the side just to see what it was like really appealed to me. It's always cathartic and weird to step back and look at how you are acting and think, how does this even make sense. Like I know how women are. Knowledge is power and just that general knowledge will make me better. I now not only understand this on an intellectual level but also on another visceral level where I really do get that doing this type of thing to women is not a viable strategy to get what you want, whether that is a relationship or sex. Once you truly figure out what makes them tick enough to be able to sustain something non-serious long term, you could try again. as it is, you as a person are still too malleable to you outside influences. You crumble in the face of certain types of adversity. Become anti-fragile. I remember when that was the buzzword of the day. It is almost certainly something that I have even mentioned in this blog. Amazing how you can simultaneously attract massive amounts of attention and attraction from some women while others don't want you for any reason. It's so different an experience form any women where there is almost no guy on the planet that many of them couldn't get with dedication and pussy. Though in the same sentence that is not true because there are guys Like Senna1 how I admire that ave been through the shits and don't give a fuck about that side of women. Sex is sex and they could give or take it. It is all just about having experiences and having fun and these dudes have family and business priorities that trump pussy. one day"
kristin osbourn,2016-02-26 06:22:00,"I just wanna be close to you. Thant's the line that sticks with me. Jay Sean song. II just wanna be close to you. I't seems like that's what I am longing for in the club. but I can never quite achieve it. It stays elusive. I can dance with girls. I can have a good time. but maybe I'm expecting that they'll leave me at some point. They'll leave for a friend, the.y leave for a guy or they'll leave me with a number that they don't respond to. I really like this girl. but also I'm not sure if it's her or her attractiveness. It's actually definitely her attractiveness. but still. I like her. I'm afraid to lose her. I'm afraid to show that I'm afraid to lose her. I like her and I'd like to see where this goes. But at the same time I want to be a hoe. I want to master this game. with bunnies, with deer, with bears (not so much though) I want to be great enough to be one of the gurs that can more or less habe his pick. That would be cool for me. I haven't let go yet. I haven't truly let go of who I've become and the name I built for myself. I haven't been in god mode in a long time. I miss it. Maybe that's one of the missing pieces to my current life. But the question is: is it possible to be in a constant god mode because you like a girl so much? I'm kinda scared because although I want it to work out, I'm scared of her finding out my age. I'm scared of her finding out my past. I'm scared of her really really knowing me. No one really really knows me. I'm real life really alone out here. I have a couple people who know many things about me and can attest to my character. but no one knows what I live with. no one knows what I struggle with. I dont know. I would count tonight and yesterday night a success. I got numbers, I kissed girls. I did stuff. and tonight I went on a date with a very pretty girl. I can kinda see through the mirage of sex and see that she's less attractive than vida, my true love. but she's still very pretty. I'm just writing now. I'm going to stop and eat ice cream and watch one of my tv shows bye"
mary kissed hussain. and she already fucking someone else,2021-04-20 20:27:00,"wowwowwowwowwowwowwowwowhait's strange to be here. i am not even mad. just sad and disappointed. disappointed that people that i spent so much time with could betray my trust. its truly something else. that said i did the same to her so what can i say. i'll call the kettle black and with the same mouth say, yeah, i deserved that. i deserved that for the way that i treated her and the way that i treated lisa.that said, fuck man. that's fucked. and to hussain, man sure you didn't fuck her but shit man, you slept in a bed with her, made out with her for according to you a good bit, all the while knowing how much i cared about her and how much it was eating at me that she was out in the world. that's crazy. man i forgive you but shit this is different. this shit hits different. i knew something had to already have gone down or be going down and i'll give that benefit of the doubt based on that i value your wordbut i don't really believe it to be honest. and it's truly different to do something like this. what can i say. i'm hurt. i'm just hurt. and i know that i shouldn't focus on this shit and that you become what you think about and all that but damn man it's just wild that this is a thing that can happen and that did happen. that a girl can fuck with your friends. that's crazy. mary why would you do this. to get revenge? okay, you got it. you win. i'm sad. i always wanted things between us to work. i wanted to be your friend in some weeks. i really do love you. but this is crazy. this is crazy man. how can you tell someone osme this one day and d osome other shit the next day. and i know it's ironic as hell that its' ME saying this after cheating for months but still. fuck you, it still hurts when your trust is betrayed regardless of what you did. sure, i'm wrong but that doens't discount my feelings. that said, in the end, you made your bed and now you have to sleep in it. you put bad energy into the world and now you're seeing the results. i know you'll undoubtedly make mistakes in the future, chi but for the love of god, please consult with wise people for a second first. don't get hurt you fucker.i am feeling some of that self hate rise up again in response to being duped so thoroughly and completely. it just shows that anyone can get got. even the god king himself. you know and i just want to hear her voice. i just want to hear her tell me the shit herself. i want to feel the direct hit of the pain. i want to hate. i want to hurt. i do. and it's a strange thing. every time we had the open relationship shit i hurt every time but fucking damnit i needed to know. i needed to hear the details of the dick. i needed to hear the date, the experience, what the guy was like. and in every one of these hurtful situations, i would sit in silence not caring about or ignoring most of the pain. sitting in it. until it bubbled out. it's a way that i kill myselfi kill whatever weak cunt created the circumstances for that thing to occur in the first place. the only issue with the last 8 months has been that i haven't finished the murder. i've had the pain but haven't followed through with the knife. ha. you care about her. you love her. shut the fuck up. you chillin. go suck some new pussy. go vibe somewhere. i'm done with your pussy shit nigga. you been a bitch and you're experiencing bitch shit. i just sent hussain a text saying he can fuck her if he gets the chance. i'm done with mary. i'm good."
first name sam last name whatever,2016-05-16 14:28:00,"Jesus. I should've written a new blog post months ago. My life has changed so much and there is so much shit that I have to get off my chest. First things first, what happened today. I went out with my friend Adam, Gabs, Kobe and Kobe's girlfriend sarah. Nothing eventful happened for most of the night I know my friend adam likes Sam, one of the yoga girls that attended so I made sure that the afternoon was entertaining. There were so many moments where that conversation would just have sat there and been done id I hadn't stepped in with whatever I stepped in with. It would have been better had I had more sexy or better topics to talk about but I know that adam was playing the long game any way so this wouldn't be an issue. I went ahead and broached many topics. First I'd like to say that this girl that didn't like me before invited me to a wedding with her next weekend as an olive branch. Instead of saying yes, I offered m my friend adam instead. she does not have my number so this is an actual and legitimate choice for her. I think that I could entertain her and that she could me, bu t the same time she would end up pissing me off with some bullshit or I her wit my antics. any way back to the story. I was talking to this girl sam when we went pack to her place (adam gabs and IP) and I was talking.after I was done talking she was flustered in a good way.. nervous to look up and not willing / forth coming to open her eyes and look me in the eyes or match my stare. she got offended and started giving me shit for that. I called her out on her bullshit. there's no fucking way that I am going to let some girl call me sexist or misogynist and get away with it (she didn't do this explicitly but if was implicit in her actions) (which is bullshit but it was the case so fuck you too)l I told her she looked cute when she was flustered. Apparently, you are not allowed to say that to a feminist or a women that hate men. This is the sad shape that men can't even give compliments to the opposite sex for fear of condemnation from some members of society. fuck it let me go a little bit higher in my analysis here. I saw that this shit was not going anywhere. The conversation was dying and there weren't enough leaders in the room to keep something going. It so interesting watching everyone look to me for support on the future conversation thread. day 2 of this blog post I went out with Brady all day today. He's a great guy. I do most of the talking and he just listens. It is good to be on the talking side and not the constant reciever of shit. I need that . I thik that is why therapy might be super helpful for me. I just neeed someone to tlak to about my shit and someone to help me in my journey of self knowledge. What is it about me that shoos away serious relationships? It really has to be me at this poitn. I can no longer blanket group all of the girlsthat I have had interactions with into one group and say that noe of these women want relationships. The truth of the matter is that that is the most untrue thing. They want whatever is givent to them and if I am able to probie that feeling of safety, security and belonging, I could get a girlfriend. The problem is I have no idea how to do that. I am so good at just talking about shit that doesn't matter. I'm great at filibustering conversation until I come across something that the person (girl) can respond back and forth to. The issue is I have no concept of the balance between real shit and this nonsense/jokes. There is either all of one or all of the other and I have no way to calibrate. Sticking point of the weekend and this semester - inability to calibrate out of nonsense and jokes to actual meaningful emotional connection (whatever that means). I don't think that I have emotionally connected with any girl that I have met in the past year. That is saying a lot considering I have spoken to hundreds of women in that time. Maybe I'm exaggerating that I haven't connected emotionally but I can say that I haven't connected on any sort of deeper level to where I was interested in the girl's viewpoints more than her ass. This will be a nice week to let loose one last time on the streets. own them. Make them mine. run them one last week. then figure this relationship shit out. When I go to West Virginia, I need to make a genuine change. The first thing is that I will not consume alcohol when going out. If anything I can buy a red bull out at a bar or just continue to drink water. I don't need the help of a drug to being my inner self out to interact with the opposite sex (anymore). I really need to figure out what makes them tick. I need a deep dive into theoretical game and how to apply it in the real world. I need to understand everything that I can about now I am making them feel and how to emotionally connect myself. One thing that upsets me about girls these days that if she is attractive she is almost definitely indoctrinated. under the religion n of marxism or the religion of religion, she is indoctrinated and realistically she will be out of reach for me. At least I will refuse to support in take part in such things that I think do more harm than good, i.e. she does not meet my intellectual standards. This all in one sentence: modern girls do not meet my intellectual standards. Across the board, even the smartest ones, have been fed lies since their childhood and are unable to think. This is obviously an issue as I am a very strong skeptic, and believer in the pursuit of rational empirical truth through the use of the scientific method. Any way, Adam slept over at sam's place last night. My good cop bad cop routine worked and I am 100% responsible for his success that night. I am also responsible for Gabs shift into being a how. Its wonderful but she also disgusts me. To the point were people notice a change in my demeanor and personality when she is around. I think she reminds me of my mom. Specifically, in her actions when I say true things to her. My mom will just tune me out and not respond to anything i say. She can't handle to hear a contrary opinions because her faith and belief s are build on such shaky empirical and philosophical ground. Most of this shit can be debunked with a simple google search. I hate that attitude and it is that kine of shit that left my mother in an abusive relationship with my father for more than 23 years. physical and verbal abuse everyday raining down regardless of the presence of children was endured all because of the lack of critical thinking and ability to listen to opinions about the guy from others. It's bull shit and I know that she is going to put some kid or some man into a similar or worse situation where she is a single mother and contributing to the prison and bottom 20% of the income bracket (I definitely made that last stat up but you get my point critically)."
inadequate,2023-11-19 13:11:00,"i don't feel good enough. i don't feel goo enough to post on x or tiktok. i feel that i don't have nything ot contrubute to the conversation. which is ironic for how often i promotoe others start making content. i am building but not hard and not fast. i am confused for what i want to do. i 'm scared that i won't live to my potential. and at this rate, i won't. there's too much larp and not enough actoin. i am coming up with ideas but i'm not about that action. i am scared.i'm scared that i'll get in touch with people and then not want to do what i'm doing anymore and kinda get locked into selling or doing something that i don't want to do. man i sleep so much because sleep is non existence. where is this coming from. i think it's because i've been on x and i feel like i can't post something that will be seen or appreciated by anyone. and that's true obviously. i haven't earned the right to be seen. even now i'm being seen but its cheap attention. it's free attention. the question is how to get people to pay attentnio that is winning. death is nice too. in the end, none of it matters. and ai will assemble and become greater than us all."
she said no to china,2025-04-07 14:01:00,"I want to make this post. i recorded a vide obut there ‘s something special about the written word. the distillation of thoughts ideas and emotions in the static medium of text. it’s beautiful.

Not exact emotions but i’m just not vibing well. i am dissappoinrtted the klaudija didn’t want t o some to china with me. man i even offered to buy here. a ticket. haha. and saying it like that with teh history of me writing about her here is hilaroious. it really puts it in perspective. I really have been simping. Ibut it’s okay. I’m okay with who i am with her. I dont’ feel the pressure to change.. i more feel the sadness that i”M not enough for her. i wish i could be. . i wish i could be the strong capable god that she would feel is comfortable and powerful and rich enough to go with ehr anywhere in the world. how naive of me thorugh. i think she’s a snow bunny. i don’t really think it, i think i konw it. the bachate. the way that she reached out proactively to me multiple times. i mean. even had a comment the other night where i said something like i don’t konw any black guys or black people that X and she said “oh wow i konw many”. it was a throwaway comment but i think she is gettting more comfortable with being open with me about her life and the fact that she’s into other shit that isn’t me. i’m a boring guy. i can be interesting. i can be fun. i can be a dream. but 90% i’m just a person in teh world. i genuinely fear often that i’m not enough for this world. i’m not enough for women writ large. my existence tand the things that i do just aren’t attractive and enough for the modern female. do i really beleive that? at a deep level, yes. and yet i keep going out sometimes in hope that i will be wrong one day. with mary and lisa and regina and probably madina, i was wrong… alas, i fucked things with mary and lisa back then and i don’t like regina much and i never tried with madina for whatever reason. it was nice to just exist and have fun with someone. i don’t regret any of it. i loved her and i loved the way we would dance and spend time. crazy life mani get nervous that when the time comes, i don’t be enough. the girl will get bored. the girl will find something better in the world. part of me thinks its genuinely inevitable. it doesn’t feel physically possible to meet a girl who likes me long term man. that just feels so damn far out of reach. and while i say that, i know that poland is just a small flight away. i konw that lithuania and serbia are right fukcing there. i konw that with content i could spin up again. i konw that talkign to peple for a few weeks would get me places i could never imagine. i know that learning some language and going back out the the village would yield results. i konw there’s hope. there’s so fucking much hope. there’s so much. and there’s POC after POC. and still with everything, i still feel the self-attack or the self-wallowing after her text. such is the way. it’s april man. i’m 31. crazy"
i'm done with klaudija,2025-01-17 14:31:00,"1/17/25 9:31 PMi mean i'll sit with it but i'm done. there's just nothing there and i've been trying. and i'm comfortable with saying that i've tried. i asked if she was free to have a 30m chat this evening and she said, ""Thanks but I already made plans.""LMAO what?? you made plans and you won't have any room to breath the whole time?? it's stupid when i talk about it. i have to laugh at myself a bit. it's actually funny. like i'm a bit angry at muself but it's more funny than anything. what's funny? it's the idea of me in this state. it's the context of life ot bring me to this place again. it looks different but it tastes oh so familiar. i won't be disrespected though. and continuing in this is me disrespecting myself. 1/18/25 1:28 AMidk why. i love the pain of thinking about her banging another guy. it's so fucked. i want to drown in misery with the sure confirmation that i'm not good enough and will never be good enough to keep a beautiful girl like that interested. oh sweet sweet deathwish. the demons. the deomons they call to me. the thought that keeps coming back is the nebulousness of her plans always. this is what people do when they are outside fuckinthe sights are all there man. 1) she explicitly and completely forbids you from coming to her city. my guess is she is still dating someone or messing around and she doesn't want it to be more complicated than it is.2) she goes dark. and going dark is normal. but the whole, ""i need to be alone so i can't communicate for multiple days"". yeh fuck that, because the amount of time you need or could give to someone you cared about is infinite. not actually but preciseness isn't my goal right now3) won't share even one detail about sexual history. she's ashamed for whatever reason.4) avoids answering questions of all types shapes and sizes.she want's her cake. and you're letting her eat it too."
hello my old friend. now is not the time,2017-04-02 11:33:00,"It is just you and me as always. Why do I go out? Why do I force myself to do something that I do not want to do? Hmm. This is a trend. I force myself to study so that I can get a degree that I don't want so that I can get a job that I could do without the piece of paper, though the piece of paper is required. I force myself to socialise and speak to women when I want to do the opposite of that thing. I want to be home sitting alone playing guitar listening to my thoughts and watching art. I want to get better at French. But for what? So that I can go to that country and be rejected by their most beautiful women as well? Every time one of those super attractive girls looked at me, I felt small. I felt insignificant. I felt like a piece of nothing. A common stop sign that you have to drive by on the way to work. The object that forces you to stop for a second and look at it and make sure you are safe before continuing on with your day and life, altogether forgetting the forgettable experience of Chi. Annoying. I can get the girls with boyfriends. I can get the 6s. I can sometimes rarely bag a 7. But never ever higher. I've maxed myself out and I feel like the only way I can get better from here is to rebuild myself from the ground floor up. I need to go day by day till I am a new person. But I really don't want to do that here in Morgantown. I really don't want to do that for awhile actually. I like riding this Chi bike and I could do it for a bit longer. Enjoy the solitude of the mind. Enjoy the levels that you still will stoop to get pussy. Enjoy the haughty rejections from girls who leave to fuck bullshit. There definitely is a sense of bitterness. It is annoying to get stumped by a shit test that I have passed so many times before. I'm not perfect but damn. Could I have done anything better? Maybe. I like dancing. Dare I say, I even more like dancing with attractive girls. Also, I hate black people. They always fight each other. They are like common wild animals. If there is more than one in the immediate vicinity of you, you are in danger. If there is more than 10... fuck outta here. You're fucked. Run as fast as you can in the other direction and hope that you don't catch a stray fist or bullet. Fuck blacks. I would not say that I hate girls, I like the idea of girls. It gets romanticised in my mind a lot when I am alone or learning to sing a love song on the guitar. I really get in my head and enjoy the fictitious versions of women that I spontaneously create. I imagine a conversation. I imagine a conversation, long and aimless, like a lazy river. Laughing and enjoying good weather and music. Enjoying each others bodies. Living life, constantly learning about the world and how to be in it. It's a wonderful idea. I don't think that it is real though I am not the man in the dream and the women certainly are not Cinderellas or Belles. I tried going to therapy. Worthless. The bitch knows nothing. The level of introspection and analysis I have is way above her identity analysis. Can you believe the first solution to my problems that she gave was that I can't get girls in this area because I'm black? Fuck off. I will waste a couple more sessions because I can and I am interested in hearing any outside perspective on my existence, Last paragraph. I do like girls. I really do. What I am struggling with is the motivation to care about them enough to slog through all of the bullshit to get to te prize... which I'm not sure of yet. A vagina? Is that what is waiting for? Every time I recognize what this all really is, it sucks and I went to quit it. Everytime iI hook a cool 6/7, every time I hear that I'm too young, or that she's too old, or that I'm black and she's not into that or that the dick isn't as big as the Jamaican boyfriend etc. etc. Every time I hear a fucking shit test I am broken back the reality of what all of this is. I'm supposed to keep going out and talking to these girls so that I can find a girl with a good face and hips and blah blah blah. Like I said before, I'm out here for my boys, that's it. I can do Immersion in pickup or relationships with women later. Now is not the time. Chi stop playing the game, go home, you're drunk."
what the fuck is wrong with me,2015-05-02 19:00:00,"I really can't do anything right. I'm actually late to everything, I can't talk to girls as well as I'd like, my grades are shit, and I'm in debt up to my ears. What the fuck. It all started with chasing women. Now, this shit has devolved into the worst kind of lifestyle and made me into a person that I hate. Now, in addition to being bad with girls, I'm a shitty person. I have kids and adults that rely on my in my volunteering and I let them all down on a daily basis. When it happens though, I get this weird feeling of indifference. Like I can't change the past so why should I be bothered by the failure that is has potential to cause me grief. It's a scary kind of indifference and this is the first point in my life that it has really started to affect me negatively. I will just do something wrong by oversleeping or not getting somewhere on time and then I think that it will be okay if I get to apologize later. I would have fired me a long time ago. I'm so scared for my future. Now, not only is my love life in jeopardy but my actual well being is close to falling apart. I don't know who I've become. I recently had a girl who was super into me. In the book, she had many good qualities but something seriously turned me off about her. Off the top ad hoc speculation, I think it is because she reminded me of my mother. I can't deal with her submissive almost unconditional 'love' for me. Even when I fuck up, when I'm clearly texting other girls, or when I clearly have lied to her, she still stayed there and liked me. Now that I am actually typing this out, I really look like a piece of shit. Last night when incidentally met up with her at the club while I was in the midst of trying to talk to a girl who I had a huge crush on, Erica P. She was doing the most. She was dancing and trying to be sensual but I just didn't want any of it. I'm scared that I've become a superficial freak. I'm no different than the girls that I hate for going after clearly hotter guys when decent looking guys would treat them better. I'm damaged goods. This is some fucked up shit and I never thought that I would act in this way. But anyway, when I met her there, I felt this weird power come over me. This strong sense of infinite manipulation. Like I could do anything to her and she would stay. Parts of me wanted to push the buttons and see what would happen. This was some sadistic shit. I would barely kiss her and just watch as she tried so hard to garner my affection. lightly kiss and back off trying to dance sensually. I would just look at her passively, expressionless trying to evoke some negative response. She then proceeded to get kinda real with me and asked if I was interested her in even the slightest. I answered with this smirk, ""Yeah but only in the slightest"". Blah blah then I left her. I walked off in search of the girl that I had come there for. Come to find that Erica had left and now so has Becky. what kind of evil shit am I slowly becoming. I need help. I really need someone to throw all of this shit at. I want to do so many things and I have so little time and my life is so stressful. Everything would be easy if I was just not me. If i was Even an earlier incarnation of Chibuzor, life might be going a lot better. Last year, I told myself that I would not do this shit again. and here we are. I'm so so scared. is my willpower that fucking low that I can't even go get what I want when I know I want it? Wow. ha at least I can go small talk with any girl in the street. I've traded who I am as a person to be able to be a guy that can talk to girls on the street and get their numbers. How much more will I lose if I actually become decent at that shit. I guess that this has been an interesting experimental phase in my life. All of this responsibility has not made me more responsible. I should be able to keep this internship regardless of how my grades end up. If I do get this opportunity, I PROMISE MYSELF THAT HERE AND NOW I WILL ARRIVE 30 MINUTES EARLY FOR WORK, CLASS, VOLUNTEERING, AND ANY OTHER SOCIAL COMMITMENT THAT I MAKE FROM HERE ON OUT. I WILL BECOME AN ADULT HERE OR I WILL DIE TRYING. i will become an adult or I will die trying i will become a leader or i will die trying"
