# Work/Project Shutdown Pattern Analysis

## Key Findings: The "Crossroads" Phenomenon

### 1. **The Mid-Point Crisis Pattern**
The subject explicitly identifies a consistent "crossroads" pattern that occurs mid-internship/project:

> "It is mid-internship where I always reach a crossroads. It is a moment where I get tired of all women and get tired of all work and start to slack off in both areas." (2016-02-10)

This suggests a predictable timeline where initial enthusiasm gives way to exhaustion and shutdown around the midpoint of commitments.

### 2. **Work Shutdown Lifecycle**

**Phase 1: Initial Enthusiasm**
- Strong start with goals and promises
- "I PROMISE MYSELF THAT HERE AND NOW I WILL ARRIVE 30 MINUTES EARLY FOR WORK, CLASS, VOLUNTEERING" (2015-05-02)
- High energy and optimism about opportunities

**Phase 2: Progressive Deterioration**
- Grades falling apart while chasing other interests
- "My life was coming together just as my grades were falling apart (as a result of my chasing of vagina instead of studying)" (2015-05-02)
- Missing commitments: "I have kids and adults that rely on my in my volunteering and I let them all down on a daily basis"

**Phase 3: The Shutdown**
- "My biggest issue in my whole life is being consistent. At the end of every activity that takes months whether it be school or a job or a relationship, I tend to slack off and the quality of my work diminishes" (2015-05-02)
- Development of "weird feeling of indifference" when failing

## Testing Psychological Hypotheses

### 1. **ADHD Executive Function (PRIMARY MECHANISM)**
Strong evidence this is the primary driver:
- **Dopamine crash pattern**: Initial enthusiasm → midpoint exhaustion → shutdown
- **Time blindness**: "I have a casual relationship with time and my schedule"
- **Consistency struggles**: "My biggest issue in my whole life is being consistent"
- **Follow-through failure**: "The amount of jobs that I've been fired from is insane"
- **Self-medication**: Heavy drinking to function socially

### 2. **Narcissistic Injury (SECONDARY)**
Present but less prominent than in relationships:
- Fear of being perceived as incompetent
- Grandiose promises followed by collapse
- Identity fragmentation: "I feel like there are 3 personalities floatin' around in me"

### 3. **Complex Trauma**
Some evidence:
- Shutdown as escape from overwhelming responsibility
- Pattern of disappointing authority figures (echoing childhood)
- "I would have fired me a long time ago"

### 4. **Attachment Disorganization**
Less evident in work contexts than relationships

### 5. **Covert Depression**
Present as consequence rather than cause:
- "depression and hopelessness" (2020-09-23)
- Energy depletion follows rather than precedes shutdown

## Key Differentiators from Relationship Patterns

1. **Timing is more predictable**: Work shutdowns follow a consistent mid-point pattern
2. **Less narcissistic injury**: Work failures don't trigger the same rage as romantic rejections
3. **More ADHD-driven**: Executive function failures more prominent
4. **Simultaneous shutdown**: Work and romantic pursuits fail together ("tired of all women and get tired of all work")

## The "Crossroads" Mechanism

The crossroads appears to be:
1. **Dopamine depletion**: Initial novelty wears off
2. **Accumulated failures**: Missing deadlines creates shame spiral
3. **Competing interests**: Hyperfocus shifts (often to women/socializing)
4. **Avoidance coping**: "weird feeling of indifference" protects from shame

## Conclusion

While narcissistic injury drives relationship shutdowns (Lisa pattern), work shutdowns appear primarily driven by **ADHD executive dysfunction**, specifically:
- Dopamine regulation failure at project midpoints
- Time blindness and scheduling failures
- Inability to sustain effort once novelty fades
- Hyperfocus shifting to more immediately rewarding activities

The "crossroads" represents the predictable point where:
1. Initial dopamine from novelty depletes
2. Long-term executive function demands exceed capacity
3. Shame from accumulated failures triggers avoidance
4. Attention shifts to more stimulating pursuits (usually women)

This suggests different interventions needed for work vs. relationship patterns.
