## Processing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Data Preparation (Week 1)
1. **Blog Posts**: Clean and standardize existing CSV
2. **YouTube Videos**: 
   - Use YouTube transcript API or Whisper for transcription
   - Fill in metadata while memories are fresh
3. **Voice Notes**:
   - Batch transcribe using Whisper or similar
   - Add context notes immediately

### Phase 2: Initial Analysis (Weeks 2-3)
Process each data source separately:

#### A. Chronological Chunks (6-month periods)
```
2015-H1: Blog posts 1-15
2015-H2: Blog posts 16-28
...
2024-H2: Blog posts 350-373 + YouTube videos + Voice notes
```

#### B. Per-Chunk Analysis Template
For each chunk, extract:
1. **Recurring Themes**
   - Relationships patterns
   - Career/work struggles  
   - Self-perception shifts
   - Coping mechanisms

2. **Emotional Patterns**
   - Dominant emotions
   - Triggers identified
   - Emotional regulation strategies

3. **Key Quotes/Insights**
   - Self-revelations
   - Turning points
   - Repeated beliefs

4. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Response to rejection
   - Approach to relationships
   - Work/life patterns

### Phase 3: Cross-Media Synthesis (Week 4)
Compare patterns across different mediums:
- Blog posts: Deliberate, edited thoughts
- YouTube videos: Extended self-reflection
- Voice notes: Raw, immediate processing

### Phase 4: Psychological Framework Analysis (Week 5)

#### A. Attachment Style Indicators
- How you describe relationships
- Fear patterns (abandonment, engulfment)
- Intimacy comfort levels
- Trust patterns

#### B. Jungian Analysis
- Shadow work evidence
- Persona vs authentic self
- Anima/relationship to feminine
- Individuation journey markers

#### C. Cognitive Patterns
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Catastrophizing
- Mind reading
- Emotional reasoning

#### D. Defense Mechanisms
- Intellectualization
- Projection
- Denial
- Sublimation

### Phase 5: Integration & Profile Creation (Week 6)

## Prompt Templates

### Initial Analysis Prompt
```
Analyze this [blog post/video transcript/voice note] for psychological patterns:

1. Attachment style indicators (cite specific examples)
2. Core beliefs about self and relationships  
3. Emotional regulation strategies observed
4. Defense mechanisms employed
5. Growth or regression from previous entries

Provide specific quotes as evidence for each observation.
Note any contradictions or ambivalence.
```

### Synthesis Prompt
```
Given these summaries from [time period], identify:

1. Evolution of self-concept
2. Relationship pattern changes
3. Persistent struggles vs resolved issues
4. Emerging themes not present in earlier periods
5. Integration of past experiences

Create a timeline of significant psychological shifts.
```

### Final Profile Prompt
```
Based on all analyses, create a psychological profile including:

1. Core personality structure
2. Primary attachment style with nuances
3. Key cognitive distortions and their triggers
4. Unconscious patterns and their likely origins
5. Strengths and growth edges
6. Recommendations for therapeutic focus

Include an "evidence trail" linking each conclusion to specific examples across all data sources.
```

## Technical Considerations

### Context Window Management
- Process in chunks of ~50,000 tokens
- Maintain a "key insights" document that travels with each stage
- Use consistent categorization across all analyses

### Quality Assurance
- Process most emotionally intense content individually first
- Cross-reference similar events across different mediums
- Note what seems to be missing or avoided topics

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Set up folder structure
   - Begin collecting YouTube video URLs/titles
   - Start organizing voice notes by date
   - Create data collection spreadsheets

2. **Tools Needed**:
   - Transcription service (Whisper, Otter.ai, etc.)
   - Spreadsheet software
   - Text editor for long-form content
   - LLM with large context window (Claude, GPT-4)

3. **Time Estimate**:
   - Data collection: 1-2 weeks
   - Processing: 4-6 weeks
   - Total project: 6-8 weeks

## Important Notes

- **Privacy**: Keep all data local and secure
- **Emotional Safety**: Take breaks when processing intense content
- **Objectivity**: Consider having a trusted friend review findings
- **Growth Mindset**: Focus on patterns and growth, not judgment
- **Future Use**: Design outputs to be useful for actual therapy
