# Psychological Self-Analysis Plan v3: LLM-Semantic Approach

## Critical Assessment of Current Approach

You're absolutely right to be skeptical of the v2 plan. Traditional NLP metrics (word frequency, statistical emotional trajectories) miss the entire point of what you're trying to achieve - **deep semantic understanding of your psychological patterns over time**.

### What We're Ditching:
- ❌ Neo4j graph database (unnecessary complexity)
- ❌ Word frequency analysis
- ❌ Statistical emotional trajectory graphs
- ❌ Traditional NLP metrics
- ❌ Complex infrastructure

### What We're Embracing:
- ✅ Pure LLM-based semantic analysis
- ✅ Narrative understanding over statistics
- ✅ Multiple psychological frameworks
- ✅ Hierarchical chunking strategies
- ✅ Simple, effective tooling

## The Core Challenge

You have 854 pieces of content (481 audio transcriptions + 373 blog posts) that contain ~10 years of psychological data. No LLM can process this all at once, so we need a smart chunking and synthesis strategy.

## Proposed Architecture: Simple but Powerful

```
1. Data Consolidation (CSV + embeddings)
   └── Master index with all content
   
2. Semantic Chunking (NOT arbitrary splits)
   └── Preserve narrative coherence
   
3. Hierarchical LLM Analysis
   ├── Level 1: Individual entries
   ├── Level 2: Weekly/monthly patterns
   ├── Level 3: Yearly themes
   └── Level 4: Cross-temporal synthesis
   
4. Multi-Framework Application
   └── Each framework gets its own analysis pass
```

## Phase 1: Data Preparation (Week 1)

### Step 1: Create Unified Dataset

```python
# master_data.csv structure
content_id | source_type | date | title | word_count | content | embedding_id

# Why: Single source of truth, easy to query
```

### Step 2: Generate Embeddings

Use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small for cost-effectiveness:
- Store embeddings locally using NumPy arrays
- Create FAISS index for semantic search
- Total cost: ~$2-5 for entire dataset

### Step 3: Temporal Segmentation

Create meaningful chunks:
- **Narrative chunks**: 3-5 related entries that form a story
- **Temporal chunks**: 1-month periods with 10% overlap
- **Thematic chunks**: All content about specific people/events

## Phase 2: LLM Analysis Strategy (Weeks 2-3)

### The Hierarchical Approach

#### Level 1: Entry-Level Analysis (Claude Opus)
```
For each blog post/transcription:

"Analyze this personal reflection for psychological patterns:

[CONTENT]

Extract:
1. Core emotional state and triggers
2. Relationship dynamics mentioned
3. Self-concept expressions
4. Coping mechanisms used
5. Unresolved tensions
6. Growth moments or insights

Focus on semantic meaning, not keywords. Identify what's unsaid as much as what's said."
```

#### Level 2: Pattern Recognition (Weekly/Monthly)
```
"Here are 10-15 entries from [time period]:

[ENTRIES WITH L1 ANALYSIS]

Identify:
1. Recurring psychological patterns
2. Evolution of specific relationships
3. Changes in self-perception
4. Emerging themes not visible in individual entries
5. Defensive mechanisms or avoidance patterns
```

#### Level 3: Framework-Specific Analysis

**Attachment Analysis Pass:**
```
"Analyze these relationship descriptions for attachment patterns:

[RELEVANT EXCERPTS]

Look for:
- Proximity-seeking vs avoidance behaviors
- Fear of abandonment markers
- Intimacy regulation strategies
- Trust and vulnerability patterns
- Idealization/devaluation cycles
```

**ADHD/RSD Pattern Detection:**
```
"Examine these emotional responses for RSD patterns:

[EMOTIONAL CONTENT]

Identify:
- Disproportionate emotional responses
- Rejection interpretation patterns
- Perfectionism as defense
- Social withdrawal after perceived slights
- Catastrophic thinking about relationships
```

**Jungian Shadow Work:**
```
"Analyze for shadow projections and archetypal patterns:

[CONTENT]

Find:
- What is rejected or criticized in others
- Recurring symbols or metaphors
- Compensatory behaviors
- Integration opportunities
```

#### Level 4: Cross-Temporal Synthesis
```
"Synthesize psychological patterns across these time periods:

[SUMMARIES FROM DIFFERENT YEARS]

Create a coherent narrative of:
1. Core psychological themes
2. Pattern evolution over time
3. Cycles and repetitions
4. Moments of breakthrough or regression
5. Unresolved core conflicts
```

## Phase 3: Implementation Tools

### Option 1: Claude Opus via Claude Code (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Best reasoning capability
- 200K context window
- You already have access
- Excellent for deep psychological analysis

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Process in batches of 10-20 entries
# Save intermediate analyses
# Build up hierarchical understanding
```

**Estimated tokens:** 10-15M total
**Time:** 40-60 hours of processing

### Option 2: Mistral Large

**Pros:**
- Much cheaper ($0.4/$2 per M tokens)
- 128K context window
- Good for initial screening

**Use for:**
- First-pass categorization
- Bulk theme extraction
- Save deep analysis for Claude

### Option 3: KIMI-K2 via Groq

**Pros:**
- Extremely fast
- Cost-effective
- Good for exploratory passes

**Limitations:**
- Less nuanced psychological understanding
- Better for factual extraction than interpretation

### Recommended Hybrid Approach:

1. **KIMI-K2**: Initial categorization and theme extraction
2. **Mistral Large**: Pattern recognition across chunks  
3. **Claude Opus**: Deep psychological framework analysis
4. **Claude Opus**: Final synthesis and insights

## Phase 4: Practical Scripts

### 1. Data Consolidation Script
```python
# combine_all_data.py
# - Read all blog posts and transcriptions
# - Create unified CSV with consistent structure
# - Generate embeddings
# - Save to local FAISS index
```

### 2. Semantic Search Tool
```python
# semantic_search.py
# - Query by meaning: "Find all content about abandonment"
# - Return temporally diverse results
# - Group by narrative coherence
```

### 3. Chunk Generator
```python
# create_analysis_chunks.py
# - Create overlapping temporal windows
# - Build narrative sequences
# - Prepare framework-specific datasets
```

### 4. LLM Analysis Orchestrator
```python
# run_llm_analysis.py
# - Manage API calls to different models
# - Save intermediate results
# - Build hierarchical insights
# - Track token usage and costs
```

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Semantic Coherence Over Volume
- Don't split entries arbitrarily
- Preserve narrative threads
- Allow 20% overlap between chunks

### 2. Multi-Pass Analysis
- Each framework needs its own focused pass
- Don't try to extract everything at once
- Build understanding iteratively

### 3. Validation Through Triangulation
- Cross-reference findings across frameworks
- Look for convergent themes
- Note contradictions as areas for exploration

### 4. Cost Management
- Start with samples before full analysis
- Use cheaper models for initial passes
- Reserve Claude Opus for deep synthesis

## What This Approach Delivers

### Instead of Statistical Graphs, You Get:

1. **Narrative Psychological Profile**
   - How your story evolves over time
   - Core conflicts and their resolution attempts
   - Relationship patterns in your own words

2. **Framework-Based Insights**
   - Attachment style manifestations with examples
   - Specific RSD triggers and patterns
   - Shadow material and projection patterns
   - Personality evolution through Big Five lens

3. **Therapeutic Roadmap**
   - Specific patterns to address in therapy
   - Historical examples for each pattern
   - Progress markers from past growth moments

4. **Living Document**
   - Not a static analysis but a queryable system
   - Can ask: "Show me all times I exhibited secure attachment"
   - Or: "When did RSD patterns peak?"
