# Psychological Self-Analysis Project Plan v2

## Updated Plan Based on Current Data Status

## Current Assets

- **481 audio files** (over 1 minute) with transcriptions in `/data/audio_for_transcription/`
- **373 blog posts** in `/data/blog_post_downloads/`
- All raw data collected and audio files converted to .wav format
- First-pass transcriptions completed for all audio files

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### 1. Create Structured CSV Files

We need to transform the existing data into analyzable CSV format:

#### A. Blog Posts CSV (`blog_posts_analysis.csv`)

```python
# Extract from existing blog posts:
- filename
- date (from filename)
- title
- word_count
- content
- primary_themes (to be added during processing)
- emotional_tone (to be added during processing)
```

#### B. Audio Transcriptions CSV (`audio_transcriptions_analysis.csv`)

```python
# Consolidate all audio sources into one CSV:
- filename
- date (from filename)
- source_type (youtube/icloud/voicememo)
- title/location (from filename)
- duration_seconds (calculate from .wav files)
- transcript (from .md files)
- word_count
- primary_themes (to be added)
- emotional_tone (to be added)
- context_notes (to be added)
```

### 2. Data Quality Check

- Verify all transcriptions are readable and complete
- Flag any files that need re-transcription
- Check for duplicate content across sources
- Identify any missing dates or metadata

## Processing Pipeline (Weeks 2-4)

### Phase 1: Initial Categorization

Process content in batches to add metadata:

1. **Chronological Batches** (Process 50 files at a time)

   - Group by year or 6-month periods
   - Add themes and emotional tones
   - Note significant events/contexts

2. **Theme Identification**
   Primary themes to track:

   - Relationships/Dating
   - Career/Work
   - Mental Health/Depression
   - Family
   - Travel/Location changes
   - Self-improvement attempts
   - Creative projects
   - Financial stress
   - Loneliness/Isolation
   - Identity/Self-concept

3. **Emotional Coding** (-5 to +5 scale)
   - -5: Severe distress/crisis
   - -3: Depression/sadness
   - 0: Neutral/factual
   - +3: Hopeful/positive
   - +5: Joy/excitement

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (Week 3)

#### A. Temporal Patterns

- Map emotional states over time
- Identify cycles (seasonal, relationship-based, etc.)
- Track theme evolution
- Note trigger events

#### B. Cross-Media Comparison

Compare how you express yourself differently in:

- Blog posts (edited, public)
- YouTube videos (semi-public, extended)
- Voice memos (private, immediate)
- Location-based patterns (at home vs traveling)

#### C. Key Metrics to Calculate

- Average emotional tone by period
- Word count/verbosity changes
- Theme frequency over time
- Relationship mention patterns
- Self-referential language changes

### Phase 3: Psychological Framework Analysis (Week 4)

Focus on evidence-based patterns:

1. **Attachment Patterns**

   - Relationship cycling
   - Fear of abandonment indicators
   - Intimacy avoidance behaviors
   - Trust issues

2. **Cognitive Patterns**

   - Negative self-talk frequency
   - Catastrophizing examples
   - Black-and-white thinking
   - Rumination indicators

3. **Behavioral Patterns**

   - Isolation tendencies
   - Substance use mentions
   - Sleep/routine disruptions
   - Coping strategies used

4. **Growth Indicators**
   - Moments of insight
   - Behavior changes attempted
   - Lessons learned (or repeated)
   - Resilience examples

## Practical Implementation

### Step 1: Create Data Processing Scripts

```python
# 1. blog_processor.py - Convert blog posts to CSV
# 2. audio_processor.py - Convert audio transcriptions to CSV
# 3. master_index_creator.py - Combine all data sources
# 4. theme_tagger.py - Semi-automated theme identification
# 5. analysis_dashboard.py - Generate summary statistics
```

### Step 2: Batch Processing Workflow

1. Process 50 items per session
2. Take breaks between emotional content
3. Keep running notes of insights
4. Flag concerning patterns for deeper review

### Step 3: Analysis Prompts for LLM

#### Initial Content Analysis

```
Analyze this [blog post/transcription] and extract:
1. Primary themes (max 3)
2. Emotional tone (-5 to +5)
3. Key quotes that reveal psychological state
4. Any mentioned relationships/people
5. Coping strategies used
6. Red flags or concerning content

Format as: theme1,theme2,theme3|emotional_score|"key quote"
```

#### Pattern Recognition

```
Given these 10 entries from [time period], identify:
1. Recurring thought patterns
2. Emotional trajectory
3. Relationship dynamics mentioned
4. Changes from previous period
5. Any crisis indicators
```

## Key Differences from v1 Plan

1. **Consolidated Approach**: One CSV for all audio instead of separate files
2. **Simplified Categorization**: Focus on 10 core themes vs open-ended
3. **Batch Processing**: 50 items at a time vs trying to process everything
4. **Emotion Scaling**: Simple -5 to +5 vs complex categorization
5. **Practical Timeline**: 4 weeks vs 6-8 weeks
6. **Focus on Patterns**: Less emphasis on specific psychological frameworks initially

## Safety Considerations

1. **Emotional Breaks**: Process maximum 2 hours per day
2. **Crisis Flags**: Immediately note any self-harm ideation for professional review
3. **Privacy**: Keep all analysis local, no cloud uploads
4. **Support System**: Have therapist or trusted friend aware of project
5. **Growth Focus**: Frame findings as opportunities for growth, not judgments

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Create `create_blog_csv.py` script to process blog posts
2. Create `create_audio_csv.py` script to process audio transcriptions
3. Process first 50 blog posts as test batch
4. Refine categorization system based on test results
5. Set up visualization templates

## Success Metrics

- All 854 pieces of content categorized and in CSV format
- Clear temporal patterns identified
- At least 10 key insights about psychological patterns
- Actionable recommendations for therapy/self-work
- No emotional overwhelm during processing
